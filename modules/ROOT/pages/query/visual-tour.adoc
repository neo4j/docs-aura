== Connection banner

If you are **not** connected to an instance, the dropdown on the connection banner lets you either select from recent instances or to specify a new instance.
Once you have entered your credentials, if needed, the status shows **Connected** and you are ready to start querying.
This dropdown is also where you can switch database, instance, or disconnect.

== Sidebar

The sidebar contains a set of drawers; database information, saved Cypher, and Query history.

=== Database information

This drawer contains information about the database you are connected to.
It gives you an overview of the node labels and relationship types, as well as what property keys exist in the database.
If you select one, you see a sample of the selected element as a graph or table.

Additionally, the drawer contains node and relationship counts, displayed in parantheses.

=== Saved Cypher

The Saved Cypher drawer is where you keep your bookmarked queries and commands.

[.shadow]
image::saved-cypher-drawer.png[width=400]

From here, you can organize your saved Cypher, download or upload these, or delete them if needed.
To run a saved query, click on it to populate it to the Cypher editor and use the play button to execute.

To save a query, use the bookmark icon in the Cypher editor.

=== Query history

This drawer contains a list of your previously run queries, for your reference.
Queries are kept here until you delete them and are not limited to the current instance.

=== Cypher Reference

The Cypher reference is an embedded version of the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-cheat-sheet/5/aura-dbe/auradb-free[Cypher Cheat Sheet].
It allows you to search for Cypher-related terms such as queries, patterns, and clauses, directly in Query.
It is divided into sections and subsections for easy navigation and each subsection can be expanded and collapsed.

[.shadow]

You can select an example to run it in the editor or copy it to the clipboard.
Note that some examples require data you may not have in your database and may not be runnable nor yield desired results, but are used to illustrate syntax and functionality of Cypher.

Every subsection is also a link to the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/[Cypher Manual] for more details.


== Cypher editor

The Cypher editor is the primary interface for entering and running Cypher queries and commands.
The editor can be instantiated several times, which allows you to edit the query inside the result frame and rerun it.
It can hold multiple lines for long queries or commands.

=== Syntax highlighting

* A smart highlight of matching pairs around the current position of the cursor, for example, matching brackets, braces, and parenthesis.
* Matching pairs are auto-closed.
* A smart highlight of identical words on a word click.
* Words, such as attributes, anon name, and values, are highlighted in different colors.
* Any punctuation, such as parenthesis and comma, has a slightly different color than text.
* Warnings are displayed with a red squiggly line that displays the error if you hover.

== Reusable result frames

The reusable result frames in Query allow you to edit the query of an existing result directly in the result fram and rerun it to update the result in situ.
You can also use _Cmd/Ctrl + click_ to send it back to the main editor and re-run it from there.

Query supports different result frame views:

* Graph -- Display the result as nodes and relationships and allow xref:query/operations.adoc#styling[styling] to be configured.
* Table -- Display the result as JSON formatted rows.
* RAW -- Display the submitted request, the Neo4j Server version and address, and the response.

== Stream

A stream is a scrolling series of result frames.

image:stream.png[]

A reusable result frame is created for each command execution, added to the top of the stream to create a scrollable collection in reverse chronological order.
You can expand and collapse the result frames using the *Collapse* icon.
To remove all the frames from the stream, use the `:clear` command.
Clearing the stream does **not** clear the history, that is done from the **Query history** drawer, as mentioned previously.

== Query co-pilot

The co-pilot is a feature that helps you write Cypher queries.
It allows you to use natural language to ask the database a question, to *query* the database in other words.
You enter your question and the co-pilot suggests a Cypher query based on your input.
You can edit the query and run it or rephrase your question to generate a new query.
The base LLM is trained on your current database schema and therefore it works best with questions asked with a clear understanding of the schema.

The co-pilot is available from the Cypher editor once you have enabled it in the Org settings.
See xref:visual-tour/index.adoc#org-settings[Organization settings] for more information.

The co-pilot is an experimental feature and is not guaranteed to always generate accurate Cypher queries.
It is recommended to review the generated query before running it, especially if the query is meant to write to the database.

Some known limitations include:

* Incorrect relationship direction.
* Using deprecated Cypher syntax.
* Tendency to not return relationships.
