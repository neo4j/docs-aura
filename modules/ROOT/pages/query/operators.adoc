= Operators

Operator commands are part of a shell-like interface within the Aura console and act as a built-in system tool.

The following commands are accessed by typing `:` in the Neo4j Aura console:

[source,cypher]
----
:access-mode
:clear
:connect
:disconnect
:history
:param
:play
:server
:style
:style reset
:sysinfo
:use
:welcome
----

== Command descriptions

=== `:access-mode`

Controls whether queries are sent in read or write mode.

- Useful for load balancing or enforcing read-only sessions.
- Current mode: `WRITE` (if shown in UI)

=== `:connect` / `:disconnect`

Establishes or terminates the connection to a database instance.

=== `:param`

Used to create or view Cypher parameters.

- Parameters can be created either via the parameters sidebar (`{}`) or by invoking this command in the query editor.
- See the official syntax guide at https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/parameters/

.Example

=== `:style` / `:style reset`

- `:style` applies styling presets to the graph visualization.

[TIP]
====
Use `:sysinfo` to investigate slow queries, memory pressure, or diagnose unexpected behavior in Aura instances.

Provides valuable diagnostic insights, especially for users working in Aura where file system access is not available.
It provides the following info in the UI:
