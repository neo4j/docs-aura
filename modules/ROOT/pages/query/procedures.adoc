= Aura Built-in Procedures Reference

This page provides a reference for built-in procedures supported in Neo4j Aura (including both AuraDB and AuraDS). 
Aura restricts access to certain administrative and custom capabilities due to its fully managed, secure architecture. 
This guide highlights what is available, how to use them, and which procedures are not supported.

The full list of Neo4j procedures is available at https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/procedures/

To check which procedures are available in your Aura instance, run the following Cypher command in the query editor or Cypher shell:

.List available procedures with default output columns
[source,cypher]
----
SHOW PROCEDURES;
----

.All procedures must be called with the CALL keyword, e.g.
[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.labels();
----

== Supported Built-in Procedures

The following procedures are available in Aura by default:

== Schema and Metadata

`CALL db.labels();`
List all labels used in the database.

`CALL db.relationshipTypes();`
Show all relationship types.

`CALL db.propertyKeys();`
Returns all property keys in use.

`CALL db.schema.visualization();`
Provides a visual representation of the database schema.

`CALL db.schema.nodeTypeProperties();`
Lists properties by node type.

== Index and Query Management

`CALL db.awaitIndex('MyIndex', 300);`
Wait for a specific index to come online.

`CALL db.awaitIndexes(300);`
Wait for all indexes to come online.

`CALL db.index.fulltext.awaitEventuallyConsistentIndexRefresh();`

`CALL db.index.fulltext.listAvailableAnalyzers();`

`CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('index', 'query');`
(requires 2+ parameters)

`CALL db.index.fulltext.queryRelationships()`

`CALL db.resampleIndex();`

`CALL db.resampleOutdatedIndexes();`

`CALL db.clearQueryCaches();`

== System and Admin

`CALL db.checkpoint();`
Triggers a manual checkpoint. Temporarily bypasses IOPS limit for faster completion.

`CALL db.ping();`
Ping the DB (for latency/debugging).

`CALL dbms.info();`
Returns version and system metadata.

`CALL dbms.listCapabilities();`

`CALL dbms.listPools();`

`CALL cdc.current();`
Lists current change data capture state (if CDC is enabled).

`CALL cdc.earliest();`
Returns earliest CDC state (if enabled).

`CALL dbms.showCurrentUser();`

== Restricted or Partially Supported Procedures

The following are known to be restricted in Aura (e.g. due to permission, cluster, or filesystem constraints). 

`CALL db.info()` 
Used for system-level diagnostics (❌ Not supported in Aura Free ✅ Supported in Aura Pro)

`CALL db.stats.status()`  
Restricted access.

`CALL dbms.procedures()` / `CALL dbms.functions()`  
Do not return full results - admin-level visibility is blocked.

`CALL dbms.listConfig()`  
Forbidden  

`CALL dbms.checkConfigValue()`  
Permission denied.

`CALL dbms.security.clearAuthCache()`  
Not allowed for user-level roles.

`CALL dbms.security.reloadTLS()`  
Same as above - admin permissions required.

`CALL dbms.scheduler.failedJobs()`  
Not supported - relates to job monitoring in cluster mode.

`CALL dbms.scheduler.groups()`  
Same - cluster job management only.

`CALL dbms.scheduler.jobs()`  
Same - unavailable in single-instance deployments.

`CALL dbms.cluster.checkConnectivity()`  
Requires clustered deployment - not available in AuraDB.

`CALL dbms.setDefaultDatabase()`  
Requires elevated access - restricted in Aura.

`CALL dbms.quarantineDatabase(databaseName, status)`  
Requires at least 2 arguments. Not permitted in Aura.

`CALL dbms.unquarantineDatabase()`
Same as above - forbidden in managed deployments.

`CALL dbms.upgrade()` / `CALL dbms.upgradeStatus()`  
Forbidden for client roles - handled by Neo4j infrastructure.

== Usable, But With Caveats

`CALL dbms.listActiveLocks('queryId')`  
Requires a valid queryId. Will return syntax error if called without arguments.

`CALL dbms.killConnection()` / `CALL dbms.killConnections()`  
Likely supported, but requires correct usage and roles. Syntax errors may occur if misused.

`CALL dbms.routing.getRoutingTable({context})`  
Requires a map input. Fails with 0 arguments. Used internally for routing in clustered setups.

== Unsupported Capabilities in Aura

Neo4j Aura is a fully managed, cloud-hosted platform, and for security and stability reasons it does not support:

* User-defined procedures  
(i.e., uploading or registering your own Java procedures or extensions)

* APOC Full  
(such as apoc.trigger, apoc.load.jdbc, apoc.custom.*, etc.)

* Filesystem-level access  
Any procedure that attempts to read from or write to the local disk is restricted.

* `dbms.security.procedures*`  
Generally locked down, especially those involving user auth, certificates, TLS reloads, or credential cache clearing.
