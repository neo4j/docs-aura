Downloading logs requires a role of either _{role-project-admin}_ or _{role-project-member}_.

You can download Query logs and Security logs.
The logs include any filters or search terms applied when the logs were fetched.
Downloading logs consists of two steps: **initiate the download** and **download the file**.

== Request the log

You can request a log for up to {max-request-hours} hours of data and a maximum of {max-download-rows} rows.

After fetching logs, use the *Initiate logs download* button in the top right corner of the *Summary* and *Details* table. 

* Select the *log type*: Summary (aggregated log statistics), Details (individual log events), or both. 
* Select a format: JSON or CSV. 
If you select CSV, you can optionally include CSV headers (enabled by default) and specify a field delimiter (default: comma).
* Select *Confirm* to request the logs.

The requested log appears in the *Downloads archive.*

== Download the log

Download logs from the *Downloads archive*.
When the status is Ready, use the Download icon to download the file.

Logs are provided as a zipped file of your selected format (JSON or CSV).
The file name follows this pattern: `<db_id>-<timestamp>-<log_type>-logs-<log_sub_type>.<format>.gz`, for example: `dd9ba752-1731586207476-query-logs-details.json.gz`

To delete a log file, select the delete icon in the Actions column.

[NOTE]
====
Log files are automatically deleted from the downloads archive after {log-download-retention-days} days.

== Downloads archive

To access the archive click the *Open downloads archive* icon in the top-right corner of the page.

The archive displays a table of all the requested logs for the selected instance.
It includes the following information about each download:
