Security log analyzer is a feature that provides a UI to review the security events on an Aura instance.

You can access security logs from *Logs* in the left-hand navigation and selecting *Security* in the tabs at the top.

To switch between instances, use the dropdown menu on the top left.

Security log analyzer is split up in two parts:

* *Summary table* - An aggregated view of security logs, giving a high level overview over the selected time period.
* *Details table* - A detailed view showing individual security events in the selected time period.

To fetch logs, press the *Fetch logs* button and select a time range for the request.
You may optionally select any filters or search text if required, then press *Fetch*.

A summary of security events is returned, showing aggregations per event.
To see the individual security events, click the right arrow at the end of the line to show details for that event.
The details pane shows individual events.

[[fetch-logs]]
== Fetch logs

The *Fetch logs* button opens up a dialog where you select the time range for the security logs. You can choose from the following intervals:

* Last 30 minutes
* Last hour
* Last 2 hours
* Last 6 hours
* Last 24 hours
* Custom time range (start date and end date)

To fetch the logs after selection of filters and search is done, click the *Fetch* button.

[NOTE]
====
Security logs are available for a period of {log-retention-days} days, and each request can be for up to {max-request-hours} hours of data.

[[filters]]
=== Filters

Use the filter button to load the available filters over the selected time period.
Filters are available for the following fields:

* Status
* Executing User
* Authenticated User
* Driver

[[search]]
=== Search

Use the search field to search for specific security events or messages.
Search can be specified for the *Message text*.
The field is case insensitive.

== Log tables

The log tables provide two different views of your security data:

* The *Summary table* aggregates similar security events, showing statistics like total count and time range. 
The table will be grouped by status and executing user.
This view helps identify patterns and potential security issues across multiple events.

* The *Details table* shows individual security events with their specific timestamps, users, and other details. 
This granular view is useful for investigating specific incidents or understanding the context of individual security events.
