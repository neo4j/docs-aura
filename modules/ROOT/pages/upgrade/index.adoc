= Patches and upgrades

Patch releases (for example, 4.2.*5* -> 4.2.*6*) and minor-version releases (for example, 4.*1*.8 -> 4.*2*.0) for the Neo4j database are automatically applied to Aura deployments when they become available.
Patching operations are non-disruptive, and you won't experience any downtime as a result.
