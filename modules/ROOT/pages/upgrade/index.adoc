= Patches and upgrades
:semver-uri: https://semver.org/

Neo4j uses semantic versioning (link:{semver-uri}[Semantic Versioning Specification 2.0.0]).
Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, the increment is based on:

* `MAJOR` version - incompatible API changes towards previous `MAJOR` version.
* `MINOR` version - functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
* `PATCH` release - backwards compatible bug fixes.

Aura uses only `MAJOR` versioning, and instructions will be provided for upgrading when there is a new major version available.

Patch releases (for example, 4.2.*5* -> 4.2.*6*) and minor-version releases (for example, 4.*1*.8 -> 4.*2*.0) for the Neo4j database are automatically applied to Aura deployments when they become available.
Patching operations are non-disruptive, and you won't experience any downtime as a result.
