// Neo4j uses semantic versioning (link:{semver-uri}[Semantic Versioning Specification 2.0.0]).
// Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, the increment is based on:
//
// * `MAJOR` version - incompatible API changes towards previous `MAJOR` version.
// * `MINOR` version - functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
// * `PATCH` release - backwards compatible bug fixes.
//
// Aura uses only `MAJOR` versioning, and instructions will be provided for upgrading when there is a new major version available.
//
// Patch releases (for example, 4.2.*5* -> 4.2.*6*) and minor-version releases (for example, 4.*1*.8 -> 4.*2*.0) for the Neo4j database are automatically applied to Aura deployments when they become available.
// Patching operations are non-disruptive, and you won't experience any downtime as a result.

Aura does not have any scheduled maintenance windows.
It is designed to be always on and available, with all corrections, fixes, and upgrades automatically applied in the background.

Releases for the Neo4j database are also deployed when they become available.
Operations are non-disruptive, and you shouldnâ€™t experience any downtime as a result.
