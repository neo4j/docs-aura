:description: A guide to the Neo4j Aura command line interface.

[NOTE]
====
The Aura CLI makes heavy use of console commands containing the keyword `tenant`.
To be consistent with that, all Aura CLI documentation pages use the term "tenant", which other parts of the documentation refer to as "project" instead, which is the xref:new-console.adoc#_topology[topological evolution] of "tenant".
====

The Neo4j Aura Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to manage your Neo4j Aura resources from the command line.
