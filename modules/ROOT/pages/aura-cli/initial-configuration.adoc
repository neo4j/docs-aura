== Configure Aura CLI with an Aura API key

Configure the Aura CLI with the Aura API client ID and client secret you obtained earlier.
The Aura CLI refers to these as "credentials".
You can have several sets of credentials and  choose which one to use.

. At the command prompt, enter the following, using your values for the items in CAPITALS:
+
[source, shell]
----
aura-cli credential add --name YOUR\_LABEL --client-id YOUR\_CLIENT\_ID --client-secret YOUR\_CLIENT\_SECRET
----
+
. To confirm the credentials are working, list your Aura instances:
+
[source, shell]
----
aura-cli instance list --output table
