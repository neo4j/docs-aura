= Tool authentication
:description: This section describes the seamless tool authentication functionality in AuraDB.

Organization admins can allow users in a project to seamlessly and securely connect to a project and the instances within it.

This feature can be enabled and configured from the Org settings.

As an Org admin, you maintain access control of all projects within the organization.
You can select which projects and instances users can connect seamlessly to and which they should be required to use username and password to connect to.
To prevent unauthorized access and allow Project admins full access control, the authentication is used in conjunction with predefined roles with varying levels of access to the database.
This means that Project admins assign roles to the users that grants them seamless connection to the project and its instances as well as certain privileges to the databases there.
See xref:user-management.adoc#roles[User management - Roles] for more information.
