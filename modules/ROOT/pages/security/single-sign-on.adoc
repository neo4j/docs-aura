== Introduction to SSO

Single Sign-On (SSO) enables you to use your organization’s identity provider (IDP) to authenticate users so they can access the Aura console and Aura instances.

Aura supports SSO authentication and authorization using https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc[Microsoft Entra] and link:https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oin-sso-overview/[Okta] as identity providers, implementing the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol.

As the service provider, Neo4j Aura redirects authentication requests to the configured identity provider (IDP) using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. 
When a user attempts to log in, Aura generates a redirect URL with authentication parameters and sends the user to the IDP for authentication. 
Upon successful login, the IDP redirects the user back to Aura with a secure token, allowing Aura to establish an authenticated session.


== SSO levels

`Organization admins` and `Organization owner` roles can configure SSO at the organization-level and project-level.
SSO is a log-in method. 
Access, roles, and permissions are dictated by role-based access control (RBAC).

* *Organization-level:* Allows org admins to control how users log in when they are trying to access the organization. It is a log-in method for the Aura console.

* *Project-level:*  Impacts new database instances created within that project.
It ensures users logging in with SSO have access to the database instances within the project.
It depends on RBAC if the user can access and view or modify data within the instances themselves.
For this level, the role mapping may be used to grant users different levels of access based on a role in their identity provider (IdP).
It *does not* give access to edit the project settings, for example to edit the project name, network access, or to edit the instance settings such as to rename an instance, or pause and resume.

== Log-in methods

Log-in methods are different for each SSO level.
Administrators can configure a combination of one or more of the log-in methods.

*Supported log-in methods at the organization-level:*

* Email/password
* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Google SSO (not Google Workspace SSO)

*Supported log-in methods at the project-level:*

* User/password
* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID

At the project-level, admins cannot disable user/password. 
However, at the organization-level, admins can disable email/password and Google SSO as long as at least one other custom SSO provider is configured.

== Setup requirements

Accessing Aura with SSO requires:

* Authorization Code Flow
* A publicly accessible IdP server

Aura requires the Authorization Code Flow, an OAuth2 authentication method that involves redirecting users to an Identity Provider (IdP) for login.

To create an SSO Configuration, either a Discovery URI or a combination of Issuer, Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint, and JWKS URI is required.

== Create a new SSO configuration

. From the *Organization settings*, go to *Single Sign-On* to set up a new SSO configuration.

. The checkboxes *Use as a log in for the Organization* and *Use as login method for instances with projects in this Org* define whether SSO should be only on organization-level, only on project-level, or both. 
Selecting both checkboxes means the SSO setup applies to both the organization-level and project-level.

. The required basic SSO configuration information can be retrieved from the IdP.
Entering the Discovery URI pre-fills the fields below.
If this is not known these fields can be completed manually.

== Role mapping

Role mapping applies to all new instances created within the selected project.
To configure role mapping for an individual instance, contact support.

== Individual instance-level

Support can assist with SSO configurations at instance-level including:

* Role mapping specific to a database instance
* link:https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/create-custom-claims[Create custom claims] besides `groups`
* Updating SSO on already running instances

== Support

If you require support assistance, visit link:https://support.neo4j.com/[Customer Support] and raise a support ticket including the following information:

. The _Project ID_ of the projects you want to use SSO for. Click on the project settings to copy the ID.

. The name of your IdP

== Azure SSO configuration

. Navigate to Azure at link:portal.azure.com[portal.azure.com]

. Go to Microsoft Entra ID 

. Go to App Registrations and then New Registration

. Add a name for the new app registration and click Register. Skip redirect URI’s for now.

. On the app overview page, take note of the Application (client) ID.

. Click the Client Credentials link to navigate to the client credentials page.

. Create a new secret and take note of the Value field, you won’t be able to see it again after leaving this page.

. Go back to the app overview page and open the app endpoints and take note of the Open ID Connection metadata document uri

. Under Authentication on the left side nav, setup redirect urls by adding a new Web platform and adding https://login.neo4j.com/login/callback as the redirect URI. 

. Create an Azure SSO config via console. You can do this via the org settings for your org. On the SSO config create form, do the following:

.. (Optional) Select if you want the SSO config to be applied to org logins, to specific tenants within the org, or both

.. For IdP Type select Azure Active Directory

.. For Client ID enter the Application (client) ID from the azure app

.. For Client Secret enter the client secret value (not secret id) from the secret you created in the azure app

.. For Discovery URI enter the OpenID Connect metadata document uri

.. Configure the rest of the SSO config as you’d like

.. Click Create

.. To test Instance SSO, create an instance now in a tenant that has the just created SSO config linked.

== Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting SSO spans multiple systems such as the Aura console, Auth0, IdP, Workspace/Desktop, and Instance.

=== Correct tokens

Ensure that the IDP is issuing valid tokens with the correct claims required for authentication.
If authentication issues persist, verify the token contents using an online JWT decoder.
