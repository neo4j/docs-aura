== SSO levels

Organization admins can configure SSO on organization level and project level.

SSO is a log-in method and access, roles, and permissions are dictated by role-based access control (RBAC).

* *Organization-level:* Allows org admins to control how users log in when they are trying to access the org.
Access beyond log-in is managed via RBAC.
It is essentially a log-in method for the Aura console.

* *Project-level:*  Impacts new database instances created within that project.
It ensures users logging in with SSO have access to the database instances within the project.
It depends on RBAC if the user can access and view or modify data within the database instances themselves.
For this level, the role mapping may be used to grant users different levels of access based on a role in their identity provider (IdP).
It *does not* give access to edit the project settings, for example to edit the project name, network access, or to edit the instance settings such as to rename an instance, or pause and resume.

== Log-in methods

Log-in methods are different for each SSO level.
Administrators can configure a combination of one or more of the log-in methods.

*Organization-level supports:*

* Email/password
* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Google SSO (not Google Workspace SSO)

*Project-level supports:*

* User/password
* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID

At the project level you cannot disable user/password, but at the org level you can disable email/password and Google SSO as long as you have at least one other custom SSO provider configured.

== Setup requirements

Accessing Aura with SSO requires:

* Authorization Code Flow
* A publicly accessible IdP server

To create an SSO Configuration either a Discovery URI or a combination of Issuer, Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint and JWKS URI is required.

== Create a new SSO configuration

From the *Organization settings*, go to *Single Sign-On* to set up a new SSO configuration.

The checkboxes *Use as a log in for the Organization* and *Use as login method for instances with projects in this Org* define whether SSO should be only on Organization level, only on Project level, or both.

The required basic SSO configuration information can be retrieved from the IdP.
Entering the Discovery URI pre-fills the fields below. 
If this is not known these fields can be completed manually.

== Individual instance-level

Support can assist with SSO configurations at instance-level including:

* Role mapping specific to a database instance
* Custom groups claim besides `groups`
* Updating SSO on already running instances

If you require support assistance, visit link:https://support.neo4j.com/[Customer Support] and raise a support ticket including the following information:


. The _Project ID_ of the projects you want to use SSO for.
See xref:platform/user-management.adoc#_projects[Projects] for more information on how to find your __Project ID__.

. The name of your IdP
