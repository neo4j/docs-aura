= Supported TLS cipher suites

For additional security, client communications are carried via TLS v1.2 and TLS v1.3.

AuraDB has a restricted list of cipher suites accepted during the TLS handshake, and does not accept all of the available cipher suites.
The following list conforms to safety recommendations from IANA, the OpenSSL, and GnuTLS library.

TLS v1.3:

* `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (RFC8446)`
* `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (RFC8446)`
* `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (RFC8446)`

TLS v1.2:

* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (RFC5288)`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (RFC5289)`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (RFC5289)`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (RFC7905)`
* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (RFC5288)`
