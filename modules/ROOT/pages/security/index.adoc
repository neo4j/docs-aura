= Security

== Encryption

All data stored in Neo4j Aura is encrypted using intra-cluster encryption between the various nodes comprising your database, as well as encrypted-at-rest using the underlying cloud provider's encryption mechanism.


== VPC isolation

label:Enterprise-only[]

Aura Enterprise runs within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) isolation for your deployment.

The VPC enables you to operate within an isolated section of the service, where your processing, networking, and storage are further protected.

Please note that the Aura console runs in a separate VPC.


== Supported TLS cipher suites

For additional security, client communications are carried via TLS v1.2 and TLS v1.3.

Aura has a restricted list of cipher suites accepted during the TLS handshake, and does not accept all of the available cipher suites.
The following list conforms to safety recommendations from IANA, the OpenSSL, and GnuTLS library.

TLS v1.3:

* `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (RFC8446)`
* `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (RFC8446)`
* `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (RFC8446)`

TLS v1.2:

* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (RFC5288)`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (RFC5289)`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (RFC5289)`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (RFC7905)`
* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (RFC5288)`
