= Azure using Private Link

Create a private endpoint in your Azure Virtual Network (VNet).

All traffic remains within your VNet.

Setup steps:

Go to Security > Network Access in the Aura Console.

Select New configuration, choose your region, and enter your Azure Subscription ID.

Enable Private Link and copy the generated Private Link service name.

In the Azure portal, create a new Private Link endpoint using the service name.

Return to Aura Console to accept the connection.

Test connectivity before disabling public traffic.

Refer to Azure Documentation for required permissions.

== How Private Links Work

Private links securely connect your application to Aura without exposing traffic to the public internet.

PrivateLink = AWS

Private Service Connect = GCP

Private Link = Azure

When your application connects using a URI like neo4j+s://abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io, your DNS server resolves it to a private IP (e.g., 10.10.10.10). This private address forwards the connection through the private ingress to the appropriate Aura instance.

Custom endpoints (e.g., my-endpoint-abc123.endpoints.neo4j.io) require additional DNS records:

my-endpoint-abc123.endpoints.neo4j.io IN A <ip-address>
a-my-endpoint-abc123.endpoints.neo4j.io IN A <ip-address>
...

Or use a wildcard:

*.endpoints.neo4j.io IN A <ip-address>

[NOTE]
====
Use wildcard DNS only if all private endpoints resolve to the same IP. Otherwise, use individual records
====

Testing Private Endpoint Connectivity

To confirm connectivity:

Use nslookup:

nslookup abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io

Use curl:

curl https://abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io

Use nc (netcat) or PowerShell:

nc -vz abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io 7687
Test-NetConnection abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io -Port 7687

Check relevant ports based on product:

7687, 7474, 443 for AuraDB

8491 for AuraDS

This consolidated guide ensures your Aura deployment is secure, compliant, and reliably connected through private network configurations.
