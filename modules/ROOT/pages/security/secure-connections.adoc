AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud and AuraDS Enterprise run in a dedicated AWS cloud account, Azure subscription, or GCP project to achieve complete isolation for your deployment. 
Additional Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) boundaries enable you to operate within an isolated section of the service, where your processing, networking, and storage are further protected. 
The Aura console resides in a separate VPC, isolated from the rest of the Aura services.

== Network access overview

Aura instances support public access, private access, or both.

* Public access allows traffic over the internet using the correct credentials.
* Private access uses private endpoints and requires traffic to remain within your cloud provider's network.

To configure settings for network access to your instance, go to *Aura console > Project settings > Security & Networking > Private endpoints > New network access configuration.*

The Aura console provides a step-by-step configuration guide to:

. Choose your Aura instance details

. Create an endpoint

. Accept endpoint connection requests and enable private DNS in the cloud providerâ€™s console

. *Disable public traffic.* It is highly recommended to test connectivity through the private endpoint before disabling public traffic. Return to Step 4 at any time to disable public traffic.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling public traffic is not instant. Monitor the status change in the console to confirm when the process is complete.
====

== Query and Explore access

When public traffic is disabled, Query and Explore are not accessible via the internet. 
To continue accessing Query and Explore, link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/getting-started/connect-instance/#_connection_method[connect via HTTPS (port 443)], this is helpful when network security blocks Bolt (port 7687), e.g. when a private link is setup on the database with public traffic disabled.
Alternatively you can set up a VPN (Virtual Private Network) in your VPC and connect to Query and Explore over the VPN.

== Private endpoints

Private endpoints are network interfaces inside your VPC, accessible only within your private network. 
The cloud provider connects them to Neo4j Aura over their internal network. They are not exposed to the public internet, ensuring access is restricted to private, secure networks.

A single private link connection applies to all instances in a region. 
If you set one up in `us-east-1` it covers all instances in that region. 
You can set up a second private link connection to applications that are hosted in a second region (e.g. `us-west-1`) but still housed inside the same Aura project.

=== AWS using PrivateLink

Create an endpoint in your AWS VPC to connect to Aura.
All traffic remains private; public access can be disabled.
PrivateLink applies to all instances in a region.
Private endpoints are one-way (Aura VPCs cannot initiate connections).

To enable:

* In the console, go to *Network Access > New configuration.* 
* Follow the setup steps and refer to AWS Documentation for IAM requirements.

[NOTE]
====
AWS region us-east-1 does not support AZ use1-az3 for private endpoints.
====

=== GCP using Private Service Connect

Create a private endpoint in your GCP VPC.

All traffic is routed privately.

Private Service Connect applies region-wide.

Setup steps:

Navigate to Network Access in the console.

Follow the configuration guide.

Refer to GCP Documentation for permission roles.

=== Azure using Private Link

Create a private endpoint in your Azure Virtual Network (VNet).

All traffic remains within your VNet.

Setup steps:

Go to Security > Network Access in the Aura Console.

Select New configuration, choose your region, and enter your Azure Subscription ID.

Enable Private Link and copy the generated Private Link service name.

In the Azure portal, create a new Private Link endpoint using the service name.

Return to Aura Console to accept the connection.

Test connectivity before disabling public traffic.

Refer to Azure Documentation for required permissions.

== How Private Links Work

Private links securely connect your application to Aura without exposing traffic to the public internet.

PrivateLink = AWS

Private Service Connect = GCP

Private Link = Azure

When your application connects using a URI like neo4j+s://abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io, your DNS server resolves it to a private IP (e.g., 10.10.10.10). This private address forwards the connection through the private ingress to the appropriate Aura instance.

Custom endpoints (e.g., my-endpoint-abc123.endpoints.neo4j.io) require additional DNS records:

my-endpoint-abc123.endpoints.neo4j.io IN A <ip-address>
a-my-endpoint-abc123.endpoints.neo4j.io IN A <ip-address>
...

Or use a wildcard:

*.endpoints.neo4j.io IN A <ip-address>

[NOTE]
====
Use wildcard DNS only if all private endpoints resolve to the same IP. Otherwise, use individual records
====

Testing Private Endpoint Connectivity

To confirm connectivity:

Use nslookup:

nslookup abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io

Use curl:

curl https://abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io

Use nc (netcat) or PowerShell:

nc -vz abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io 7687
Test-NetConnection abcd1234.production-orch-0000.neo4j.io -Port 7687

Check relevant ports based on product:

7687, 7474, 443 for AuraDB

8491 for AuraDS

This consolidated guide ensures your Aura deployment is secure, compliant, and reliably connected through private network configurations.
