AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud and AuraDS Enterprise run in a dedicated AWS cloud account, Azure subscription, or GCP project to achieve complete isolation for your deployment. 
Additional Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) boundaries enable you to operate within an isolated section of the service, where your processing, networking, and storage are further protected. 
The Aura console resides in a separate VPC, isolated from the rest of the Aura services.
Connections using private endpoints are one-way, as Aura VPCs doesn't initiate connections back to your VPCs.

== Network access overview

Aura instances support public access, private access, or both.

* Public access allows traffic over the internet using the correct credentials.
* Private access uses private endpoints and requires traffic to remain within your cloud provider's network.

To configure settings for network access to your instance, go to *Aura console > Project settings > Security & Networking > Private endpoints > New network access configuration.*

The Aura console provides a step-by-step configuration guide to:

. Choose your Aura instance details

. Create an endpoint

. Accept endpoint connection requests and enable private DNS in the cloud providerâ€™s console

. *Disable public traffic.* It is highly recommended to test connectivity through the private endpoint before disabling public traffic. Return to Step 4 at any time to disable public traffic.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling public traffic is not instant. 
Monitor the status change in the console to confirm when the process is complete.
When activated, a Private Connection label, shield icon, and dedicated Private URI will appear on any instance in the Aura console.

== Query and Explore access

When public traffic is disabled, Query and Explore are not accessible via the internet. 
To continue accessing Query and Explore, link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/getting-started/connect-instance/#_connection_method[connect via HTTPS (port 443)], this is helpful when network security blocks Bolt (port 7687), e.g. when a private link is setup on the database with public traffic disabled.
Alternatively you can set up a VPN (Virtual Private Network) in your VPC and connect to Query and Explore over the VPN.

== Private endpoints

Private endpoints are network interfaces inside your VPC, accessible only within your private network. 
The cloud provider connects them to Neo4j Aura over their internal network. 
They are not exposed to the public internet, ensuring access is restricted to private, secure networks.

A single private link connection applies to all instances in a region. 
If you set one up in `us-east-1` it covers all instances in that region. 
You can set up a second private link connection to applications that are hosted in a second region (e.g. `us-west-1`) but still housed inside the same Aura project.
