= Vector optimization
:description: This section describes vector optimization for Neo4j Aura instances.

Vector optimization reserves memory for vector indexes, enhancing performance for vector-based operations.
It is available for AuraDB instances with more than 4GB of memory and across all supported cloud providers and regions.

This configuration re-allocates memory from the graph database to the vector index.
If this has an impact on your application, consider resizing to a larger Aura instance.

To enable vector optimization during instance creation, select *Instance details* > *Additional settings* > *Vector-optimized configuration*.

It can also be changed with the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/platform/api/specification/#/instances/patch-instance-id[Aura API].

To enable vector optimization on existing instances, from the instance card, use the *Configure* button to access *Configure instance* and find the toggle called *Vector-optimized configuration*.
You can view the current vector configuration status in the instance details, from the (*...*) menu on the instance card.

If you lower the instance size below 4GB, vector optimization is disabled automatically.

If you clone your instance to a new instance, the new instance inherits the vector optimization settings of the original instance.
But if you clone to an existing instance, its vector optimization setting remains unchanged.

== Instance sizing guide

The vector optimized configuration is intended to allow an Aura instances' available storage to be completely filled and still provide consistent vector search performance.
The table below shows the theoretical maximum GiB of vectors for each instance size, and the equivalent number of 768 dimension float-32 vectors.

GiB vectors is limited by available storage.
As larger stores become available, you can increase the vector capacity for these instances.
