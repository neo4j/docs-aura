= Cypher version
:description: This page describes how to set the default Cypher version for a database.

Neo4j supports two Cypher versions, *Cypher 5* and *Cypher 25*.

No new features are added to Cypher 5: it receives only performance and security updates, as well as eventual bug fixes.
This is the current default query language.

All new features are added to Cypher 25, which will eventually become the default language for new instances.

To make use of new features and functionality, you need to change the default language.
This is managed per Aura instance and requires a `PROJECT_ADMIN` role.
It is done using the `ALTER DATABASE` command and thus affects all queries executed against your database.
However, you can also override the default language for individual queries.

For more information about Cypher versions and commands, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/25/queries/select-version/[Cypher Manual -> Select Cypher version].
