= Enterprise fleet management
Get an enterprise-wide view of all your Neo4j systems—Aura-managed or self-managed.

For enterprise customers operating in hybrid environments, it’s common to have a mix of *Aura-managed* and *self-managed* Neo4j deployments. By integrating self-managed deployments into the Aura Console, organizations can simplify operations, reduce overhead, and plan for full migration when ready.

== *Centralized management*
Register self-managed Neo4j deployments directly in the Aura Console to:

* Monitor and manage all Neo4j databases across your organization in one place
* Seamlessly migrate to Aura with just a few clicks
* Access the latest monitoring and management tools

== Registering a self-managed Neo4j instance in Aura

To register your self-managed instance:

. Log into the Aura Console
. Navigate to [location TBD]
. Install the plugin and follow the steps provided

== Then you will be able to:

* Monitor health and performance metrics
* Run Cypher queries, explore graphs, and view dashboards
* Use the same tools across Aura and self-managed deployments
* Access powerful tools like *Query* and *Explore*—even for self-hosted databases

== Hybrid Enterprise Support

* *Continuous feature updates*
* *Unified experience* across environments
* *Transparent migration*: Move to fully managed Aura at your own pace
* *Retain full data visibility and access* via the Aura Console throughout the process
