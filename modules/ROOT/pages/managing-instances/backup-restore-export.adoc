= Backup, export, and restore
:description: This page describes how to backup, export and restore your data from a snapshot.

The data in your Aura instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots.

A snapshot is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

The *Snapshots* tab within an Aura instance card shows a list of available snapshots.
You can find the *Snapshots* tab via *Inspect* in the more menu (*...*) on the instance card.

There are different kinds of snapshots taken at different intervals with different lifecycles depending on your plan.
See <<snapshot-details>> for more information.


Aura stores the data securely in encrypted cloud storage buckets.
Backups are stored in the same Cloud Service Provider and region as the instance they are associated with.

== Snapshot types

=== Scheduled

label:AuraDB-Professional[]
label:AuraDB-Business-Critical[]
label:AuraDB-Virtual-Dedicated-Cloud[]
label:AuraDS-Professional[]
label:AuraDS-Enterprise[]

A *Scheduled* snapshot is a snapshot that is automatically triggered at a cadence depending on your plan type.

For Professional instances running the latest version, scheduled snapshots are run automatically once a day, same for both AuraDS Professional and for AuraDS Enterprise instances, For Business Critical and Virtual Dedicated Cloud instances, they run once an hour.
See <<snapshot-details>> further on for information about frequency, restorability, and exportability of scheduled snapshots, as well snapshots on instances running version 4.x.

=== On Demand

An *On Demand* snapshot is a snapshot that you manually trigger with the *Take snapshot* button.
This type of snapshot is the only snapshot available for Free instances.

== Snapshot actions

[[export-create]]

=== Export

From the more menu (...) next to an existing snapshot, you can *Export*.
*Export* downloads the instance as a `.backup` file allowing you to store a local copy and work on your data offline.
For AuraDB instances (including AuraDB instances with the Graph Analytics plugin installed) backups are always exported as a `backup` file.

=== Create instance from snapshot

You can create an instance using the data from a snapshot, just like creating a clone of an instance.
From the more (...) menu next to an existing snapshot select *Create instance from snapshot*.
This opens a window where you can assign a name to the new instance.

[NOTE]
====
The ability to Export or Create an instance from a scheduled Virtual Dedicated Cloud snapshot is limited to 14 days for 4.x instances.
For latest version instances, this is limited to 60 days for full scheduled backups.
Differential backups are not restorable/exportable and cannot be used to create a new instances from.

Additionally, for Virtual Dedicated Cloud instances running Neo4j latest version, the ability to export or create an instance from a scheduled snapshot is limited to one (full) snapshot per day.

Use the toggle **Show exportable only** on top of the list of snapshots to filter by whether a snapshot is exportable or not.

[[restore-snapshot]]
=== Restore

[CAUTION]
====
Restoring from a snapshot overwrites the data in your instance, replacing it with the data contained in the snapshot.
====

You can restore data in your instance to a previous snapshot.
Use the arrow next to the (*...*) menu on the snapshot you want to restore from.
This action overwrites the data currently in your instance and you will be asked to confirm that this is indeed desired.
If not, you can create a new instance from the snapshot instead, as described in <<export-create>>.

[[restore-backup]]
== Restore from backup file

From the *Restore from backup file* tab, next to the *Snapshots* tab on the instance card, drag and drop your _.backup_, _.dump_, or _.tar_ file or browse for it.
This action also overwrites the data currently in your instance.
If this is not desired, you can create a new instance from the snapshot instead, as described in <<export-create>>.
