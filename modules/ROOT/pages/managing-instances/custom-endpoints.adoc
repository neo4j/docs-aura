:description: This section describes custom endpoints.

Custom endpoints can be used for database management and migration.

You can create custom endpoints for your instances directly from the console.
This allows you to establish connection to a database using this endpoint instead of the `<dbid>`.

*Custom Endpoints* can be found in the Project Settings in the sidebar of the console.

Use the *Create custom endpoint* button to define your endpoint.
Choose an appropriate name for the endpoint (it can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens) and select which instance to assign the endpoint to.

Once a custom endpoint has been assigned to an instance, it will be listed along with existing custom endpoints in the menu in the Project settings.
They can be managed both from this menu as well as from the instance card.

A custom endpoint can be configured to a different instance or deleted.

[NOTE]
====
Once a custom endpoint is created or re-assigned to an instance, you have to wait three hours before you can make any further changes to it.
