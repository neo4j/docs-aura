== Snapshots

Snapshots are backups of your data.
The data in your instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots.
A snapshot is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

Neo4j regularly takes snapshots of your instance, and you can request a snapshot to be taken on demand.
These snapshots can be used to restore data to a different Neo4j instance.

// == Logs

// If something goes wrong, the logs are a good place to start.
