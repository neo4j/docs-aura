= Instance details
:description: This page describes the instance details.

From the instance card, select the more menu *(…​)* then select *instance details*.
Apart from viewing the instance details, you can also rename your instance using the pen icon next to the instance name.

|===
| Detail | Description

|Region
|Where servers are located

|Version
|The version of the Aura database

|Connection URI
|Use this to connect to an instance

|Private URI
|Applicable if you have a private link set up

|ID
|Every instance has with an ID which is a unique identifier.
It means multiple instances can have the same instance name, because they are distinguishable by their unique ID.

|Memory
|The capacity of your instance.

|CPU
|Aura provides database as a service through public cloud providers.
It runs on container technology and this allows for the AuraDB Instance to allocate dedicated CPU resources.

|Storage
|Neo4j Aura automates the backup process (you can also create your own on-demand snapshots), storing your data securely in the cloud.
Backups are saved in the storage bucket of the cloud provider in the same region as your Neo4j Aura instance.

|Encryption key
|Neo4j Managed Key encrypts your data

|===


== Snapshots

The data in your instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots.
A snapshot is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

Neo4j regularly takes snapshots of your instance, and you can request a snapshot to be taken on demand.
These snapshots can be used to restore data to a different Neo4j instance.

== Vector optimization

label:AuraDB-Professional[]
label:AuraDB-Business-Critical[]
label:AuraDB-Virtual-Dedicated-Cloud[]

Vector optimization reserves memory for vector indexes, enhancing performance for vector-based operations.
It is available for AuraDB instances with more than 4GB of memory, and is accessible across all supported cloud providers and regions.

This configuration may impact memory use and therefore may affect performance for other queries.

You can enable vector optimization with a toggle under *Additional settings* in the instance details.
This can be done both during instance creation and for existing instances.
You can view the current vector configuration status in *instance details*.

If you lower the instance size below 4GB, vector optimization is disabled automatically.

If you clone your instance to a new instance, the new instance inherits the vector optimization settings of the original instance.
But if you clone to an existing instance, the existing instance *does not* inherit the original instance's vector optimization settings.

// == Import instance

// _Feature coming soon!_

// == Logs

// If something goes wrong, the logs are a good place to start.
// The standard log is called `neo4j.log` and it contains general information about Neo4j.
// There is one for each DBMS and it can be accessed directly from Desktop via the Developer menu. It opens in a separate window, which allows you to keep it in the background.
