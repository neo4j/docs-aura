| Detail | Description

|ID
|Every instance has an ID which is a unique identifier.
It means multiple instances can have the same instance name, because they are distinguishable by their unique ID.

|Connection URI
|Use this to connect to an instance

|Query API URL
|Use this to connect to an instance with Query API

|Custom endpoint
|Applicable if a custom endpoint has been configured for the instance.
See xref:managing-instances/custom-endpoints.adoc[Custom endpoints] for more information.

|Private URI
|Applicable if you have a private link set up

|Version
|The version of the Aura database

|Region
|Where servers are located

|Memory
|The capacity of your instance

|CPU
|Aura provides database as a service through public cloud providers.
It runs on container technology and this allows for the AuraDB Instance to allocate dedicated CPU resources.

|Storage
|Backups, automated and manual, are stored separately from your instance's allocated storage.
These are saved in the cloud provider's storage bucket in the same region as your Aura instance.

Options for adjustable storage are available for AuraDB pre-paid billing on GCP, Neo4j latest version.  
See xref:managing-instances/instance-actions.adoc#_adjust_storage[Adjust storage] for more information. 

|Encryption key
|Neo4j Managed Key encrypts your data

|Vector Optimized
|Whether vector optimization is enabled for the instance or not.
See xref:managing-instances/vector-optimization.adoc[Vector optimization] for more information.

|Graph Analytics
|Whether the Graph Analytics Plugin is present or not.
See xref:graph-analytics/index.adoc#aura-gds-plugin[Graph Analytics plugin] for more information.

== Snapshots

The data in your instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots.
A snapshot is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

Neo4j regularly takes snapshots of your instance, and you can also take a snapshot on demand.
These snapshots can be used to restore data to a different Neo4j instance.

For more information, see xref:managing-instances/backup-restore-export.adoc[Backup, export, and restore].


== Restore from backup file

You can restore a database to your instance by dragging and dropping it to this tab.
It needs to be either a _.dump_, _.backup_, or _.tar_ file.
When you restore a database, all existing data is overwritten by your selected file.

See xref:managing-instances/backup-restore-export.adoc#restore[Restore] for more information.

// == Logs

// From the _Logs_ tab, you can request Query logs for a specified time frame.
