:description: This page describes how to connect to an instance in the new Neo4j Aura console.
:page-aliases: auradb/getting-started/connect-database.adoc, aurads/connecting/index.adoc

To interact with a database in an instance, you need to establish a connection.

. Go to *Import*, *Explore* or *Query*.
. Select *Status* and from there you can connect to an instance.
. You may need your *Username* and *Password* credentials.

|Connection method
| The protocol is used for the communication between the Neo4j database server and the client application or tool.
The default is `neo4j+s//`.
See below for more information about connection methods.

|Single sign-on
|If this is set up, you can use SSO.

== Connection method

To connect to an instance, you select one of the following connection methods: `neo4j+s//` or Query API.

*Neo4j*: `neo4j+s//` This is the default connection method. 
This scheme is built on  the `bolt://` protocol and uses a WebSocket connection to the Neo4j port. 
Use for best performance and stability.

*Query API*: Connect to Aura through the Query API over HTTPS on port 443 (a standard, widely open port). 
Use for debugging or when Bolt is unavailable due to network configuration.

For more information about connection schemes, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/connectors/[Operations Manual -> Configure network connectors] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/bolt/[Bolt Protocol].

== Errors 

In an enterprise environment with restrictive networking, connection errors are sometimes caused because non-standard ports used by the Neo4j protocol are blocked by firewalls.

The Neo4j protocol is built on Bolt, a binary protocol that offers optimal performance and stability, that requires an open WebSocket connection to the Neo4j port.

However, to address connection issues caused by network security policies, users can now switch to the Query API, which runs over HTTPS on port 443 (a standard, widely open port).
This ensures seamless connectivity without requiring additional configurations.
