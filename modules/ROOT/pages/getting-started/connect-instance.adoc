== Connection method

To connect to an instance, select one of the following connection methods: *neo4j+s://* or *https://*

The connection method protocol is used for the communication between the Neo4j database server and the client application or tool.
For more information about connection schemes, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/connectors/[Operations Manual -> Configure network connectors] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/bolt/[Bolt Protocol].

=== *neo4j+s://*

Establishes a TLS-encrypted connection to Neo4j using the Bolt protocol over WebSockets, with full certificate validation. 
Use for optimal performance.

=== *https://*

TLS encrypted connection to Neo4j over HTTPS (Query API), with full certificate validation. 
Use in environments where port restrictions may prevent access to the Bolt port.

== Errors 

In an enterprise environment with restrictive networking, connection errors are sometimes caused because non-standard ports (like the Bolt protocol) are blocked by firewalls when using *neo4j+s://*.

Switching to *https://* can address connection issues and ensure seamless connectivity without extra configuration.
