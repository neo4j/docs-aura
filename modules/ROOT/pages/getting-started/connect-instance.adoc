== Connection methods

To connect to an instance, you select one of the following connection methods:

*Neo4j*: `neo4j+s//` This is the default connection method. 
This scheme is built on the `bolt://` protocol and uses a WebSocket connection to the Neo4j port. 
Use for best performance and stability.

*Query API*: Connects to Aura through the Query API via HTTPS on port 443 (a standard, widely open port, compatible with most firewalls). 
Use for debugging or when Bolt is unavailable due to network configurations.

For more information about connection schemes, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/connectors/[Operations Manual -> Configure network connectors] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/bolt/[Bolt Protocol].

=== Connection error

If you encounter a connection error with the `neo4j://` connection method, try switching to Query API. 
In an enterprise environment with restrictive networking, an error is sometimes caused because the port used by the Neo4j protocol is blocked by a firewall.
