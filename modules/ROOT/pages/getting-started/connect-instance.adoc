:description: This page describes how to connect to an instance in the new Neo4j Aura console.
:page-aliases: auradb/getting-started/connect-database.adoc, aurads/connecting/index.adoc

To interact with a database in an instance, you need to establish a connection.

. Go to *Import*, *Explore* or *Query*.
. Select *Status* and from there you can connect to an instance.
. You may need your *Username* and *Password* credentials.

| Field | Description

|Connection method
| The protocol is used for the communication between the Neo4j database server and the client application or tool.
The default is `neo4j+s//`.
See below for more information about connection methods.

// |Connection URL
// |You can get this from your instance details

|Single sign-on
|If this is set up, you can use SSO.

|Database user
|Neo4j by default

|Password
|You are given the password when you initially create the instance

== Connection methods

To connect to an instance, you select one of the following connection methods: Neo4j or Query API.

*Neo4j*: `neo4j+s//` This is the default connection method. 
This scheme is built on the `bolt://` protocol and uses a WebSocket connection to the Neo4j port. 
Use for best performance and stability.

*Query API*: Connects to Aura through the Query API via HTTPS on port 443 (a standard, widely open port, ensuring compatibility with most firewalls). 
Use for debugging or when Bolt is unavailable due to your organization's network configuration.

For more information about connection schemes, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/connectors/[Operations Manual -> Configure network connectors] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/bolt/[Bolt Protocol].

== Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection errors with the Neo4j connection method, try switching to Query API. 
In an enterprise environment with restrictive networking, connection errors are sometimes caused because non-standard ports used by the Neo4j protocol are blocked by firewalls.

== Query API for Aura

The Query API allows interaction with an Aura database using Cypher via HTTPS.

For more information, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/query-api/current/[Query API documentation] but note that:

* for Aura instances host is of the format `<databaseID>.databases.neo4j.io`

* the on-prem documentation refers to port `:7474` and this is true for a on-prem install but Aura, given its HTTPS, the <port> defaults as 443.

To send Cypher queries to an Aura instance, make a `POST` request to the following API endpoint:

[source, header]
----
https://<databaseID>.databases.neo4j.io/db/<databaseName>/query/v2
----

`<databaseID>` = The unique ID of your Aura database (e.g. e011c23c).

`<databaseName>` = The target database (e.g. neo4j for the default database).

Aura supports HTTPS, which defaults to port `443`, so you don't need to specify `:443` in the URL.

This is how to create a node in Aura using `curl`:

[source, shell]
----
curl -vvv -X POST
     -H "Authorization: Basic bmVvNGo6Zm9vdGJhbGw="
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     -d "{   \"statement\": \"create (n:Person) RETURN n;\" } }"
