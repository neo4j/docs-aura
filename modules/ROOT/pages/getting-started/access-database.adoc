:description: This page describes how to access a database using Neo4j AuraDB.

With a database created, the next step is to access it.

There are a few different methods of accessing a database in Neo4j AuraDB:

* <<_neo4j_browser>> - A browser-based interface for querying and viewing data in a database with rudimentary visualization.
* <<_neo4j_bloom>> - A graph exploration application for visually interacting with graph data.
* <<_neo4j_data_importer>> - A no-code visual application for loading data into a database.
* <<_neo4j_desktop>> - An installable desktop application used to manage local and cloud databases.
* <<_neo4j_cypher_shell>> - A command-line tool used to run cypher queries against a Neo4j instance.

[TIP]
====
*Tip:* For first-time users, we recommend using Neo4j Browser.
====

== Neo4j Browser

To open a database with Neo4j Browser:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the *Open with* dropdown menu on the database you want to open.
. Select *Neo4j Browser* from the dropdown menu.
. Enter the *Username* and *Password* credentials in the Neo4j Browser window that opens. 
These are the same credentials you stored when xref:getting-started/create-database.adoc[creating the database].
. Select *Connect*.

Once you have successfully connected, there are built-in guides you can complete to familiarize yourself with Neo4j Browser.

For more information on using Neo4j Browser, please see the https://neo4j.com/docs/browser-manual/current/[Browser manual].

== Neo4j Bloom

To open a database with Neo4j Bloom:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the *Open with* dropdown menu on the database you want to open.
. Select *Neo4j Bloom* from the dropdown menu.
. Enter the *Username* and *Password* credentials in the Neo4j Browser window that opens. 
These are the same credentials you stored when xref:getting-started/create-database.adoc[creating the database].
. Select *Connect*.

For more details on using Neo4j Bloom, please see the https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/current/[Neo4j Bloom documentation].

[NOTE]
====
*Note: Perspectives in AuraDB*

Due to the nature of AuraDB's infrastructure, it is not currently possible to share Perspectives in Bloom, as the data for a given Perspective is stored in a cookie in the user's web browser.

An alternative is to export your Perspective as a JSON file and import it into another Bloom session.

To export a Perspective:

. Open the Bloom interface for your Neo4j AuraDB database.
. Navigate to the _Perspectives Gallery_.
. Click on the vertical ellipsis (*...*) and select *Export*.
. Save the file to your local disk.

You can import perspectives by clicking the blue "Import Perspective" button in the Perspective gallery.
Please note that the Perspective exposes details about your graph's schema but not the actual data within.

For more information, see https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/1.5/bloom-perspectives/[Bloom Perspectives].

== Neo4j Data Importer

label:Professional[]
label:Free[] 

The Neo4j Data Importer is a no-code tool that lets you:

. Load data from flat files (`.csv` and `.tsv`).
. Define a graph model and map your data to it.
. Import the data into your AuraDB database.

To open a database with Neo4j Data Importer:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the *Open with* dropdown menu on the database you want to open.
. Select *Neo4j Data Importer* from the dropdown menu.

Once you have opened the Neo4j Data Importer, you can follow the built-in tutorial to learn how to use the tool.

[NOTE]
====
You must provide your AuraDB database password before importing from the Neo4j Data Importer.
====

== Neo4j Desktop

You can connect AuraDB databases to the Neo4j Desktop application, allowing the ability to have a single portal for interacting with all instances of Neo4j, whether local or located in the cloud.

To connect to a database using Neo4j Desktop:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Copy the *Connection URI* of the database you want to connect to. The URI is below the database status indicator.
. In Neo4j Desktop, select the *Projects* tab and select an existing project or create a new one.
. Select the *Add* dropdown and choose *Remote connection*.
. Enter a name for the database and enter the URL from the Neo4j Aura console from the second step.
Once complete, select *Next*.
. With *Username/Password* selected, enter your credentials and select *Next*.
These are the same credentials you stored when xref:getting-started/create-database.adoc[creating the database].
. When available, activate the connection by clicking the *Connect* button.

[NOTE]
====
*Notes:*

* Neo4j Desktop only allows 1 connection at a time to a database (local or remote).
* Deactivating an instance in Neo4j Desktop won't shut it down or stop a remote instance - it will only temporarily close the connection to it in Neo4j Desktop.
====

As with other databases in Neo4j Desktop, you can install https://install.graphapp.io/[Graph Apps] for monitoring and other functionality.

To do this, follow the same process to install the graph application you need, and open it from Neo4j Desktop or a web browser with the running and activated Neo4j AuraDB instance.

== Neo4j Cypher Shell

You can connect to an AuraDB database using the Neo4j Cypher Shell command-line interface (CLI) and run cypher commands against your database from the command-line.

To connect to a database using Neo4j Cypher Shell:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Copy the *Connection URI* of the database you want to connect to. The URI is below the database status indicator.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you have installed Cypher Shell.
. Run the following `cypher-shell` command replacing:
* *`<connection_uri>`* with the URI you copied in step 2.
* *`<username>`* with the username for your database.
* *`<password>`* with the password for your database.
+
[source, shell]
----
./cypher-shell -a <connection_uri> -u <username> -p <password>
----

Once connected, you can run `:help` for a list of available commands.

----
Available commands:
  :begin    Open a transaction
  :commit   Commit the currently open transaction
  :exit     Exit the logger
  :help     Show this help message
  :history  Print a list of the last commands executed
  :param    Set the value of a query parameter
  :params   Print all currently set query parameters and their values
  :rollback Rollback the currently open transaction
  :source   Interactively executes cypher statements from a file
  :use      Set the active database

For help on a specific command type:
    :help command
