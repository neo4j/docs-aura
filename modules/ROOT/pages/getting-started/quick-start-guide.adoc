== Create an account

To access Neo4j Aura, you need to have an Aura account.
Navigate to link:https://console.neo4j.io[Neo4j Aura console] and follow the instructions for registration.
Once you have accepted the terms and conditions and verified your email address, you can start using the console.

The console exists in two versions, the classic experience, and the early access new console, as mentioned in xref:index.adoc[About Neo4j Aura console].
You can toggle between the different versions, via the account dropdown in the top right corner.

== Create an instance

The first step is to select the plan that best suits your needs.
You can upgrade your plan later if your needs change.

Once you've selected a plan, your instance is created.
A password is generated for the instance, ensure to either copy or download it, as it will **not** be recoverable after.
The password is required to access your instance later.

[NOTE]
====
You can only create **one Free instance** per account.
To create more instances, you need to upgrade your plan.
See link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/[Neo4j Pricing] for more information on the different plans.

== Migrate metadata from Workspace

If you have an existing Aura instance, you can migrate the metadata from Workspace to the new console and continue working with your data in the new experience.
The metadata includes the data model and saved Cypher queries.
//Add Perspectives and Scenes when they are available.

=== Data model

From the *Import* tab in Workspace, open the more menu (*...*) and download the model, with or without data.

Then navigate to the new console and select *Import* -> *Graph models*.
Once you select *New graph model*, you access the more menu (*...*), similar to Workspace, and select *Open model* with or without data.

Note that if you have downloaded your data with the model, you can also go a different route via *Import* -> *Data sources* and select *New data source* and then import locally from files.
This leads you to the same *Import* frame as the first route and you can use the more menu (*...*) to open the model *with* your data.

=== Saved Cypher

Any saved Cypher snippets can be downloaded from the *Query* tab in Workspace.
From the Saved Cypher drawer, use the *Export* button to download selected queries as a _.csv_ file.

Use the *Import* button and select the _.csv_ file you downloaded from Workspace.

// Perspectives, except for the default Perspective (which is automatically re-created in the new console), can be exported from the Perspective drawer in Workspace.
// Use the *Export* option on the Perspective you want to save.
// It is exported as a _.json_ file.
