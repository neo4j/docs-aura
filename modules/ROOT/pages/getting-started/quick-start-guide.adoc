== Create an account

Navigate to link:https://console.neo4j.io[Neo4j Aura console] and follow the instructions for registration.
Once you have accepted the terms and conditions and verified your email address, you can start using the console.

The console exists in two versions, the classic experience, and the early access new console, as mentioned in xref:index.adoc[About Neo4j Aura console].
You can toggle between the different versions, via the account dropdown in the top right corner.

== Create an instance

The first step is to select the plan that best suits your needs.
You can upgrade your plan later if your needs change.

Once you've selected a plan, your instance is created.
A password is generated for the instance, ensure to either copy or download it, as it will **not** be recoverable after.
The password is required to access your instance later.

[NOTE]
====
You can only create **one Free instance** per account.
To create more instances, you need to upgrade your plan.
See link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/[Neo4j Pricing] for more information on the different plans.

== Migrate metadata from Workspace

If you have an existing Aura instance, you can migrate the metadata from Workspace to the new console.
The metadata includes the datamodel, saved Cypher queries, Perspectives and Scenes.

=== Data model

From the *Import* tab in Workspace, open the [...] menu and download the model, with or without data.

Then navigate to the new console and select *Import* -> *Graph models*.
Once you select *New graph model*, you access the [...] menu, similar to Workspace, and select *Open model* with or without data.

Note that if you have downloaded your data with the model, you can also go a different route via *Import* -> *Data sources* and select *New data source* and then import locally from files.
This leads you to the same *Import* frame as the first route and you can use the [...] menu to open the model *with* your data.

=== Saved Cypher

Any saved Cypher snippets can be downloaded from the *Query* tab in Workspace.
From the Saved Cypher drawer, use the *Export* button to download selected queries as a _.csv_ file.

It is exported as a _.json_ file.
