= Migrate metadata from Workspace
:description: This describes how to migrate metadata from Neo4j Workspace to the new Neo4j Aura Console.

If you have an Aura instance created in the classic Aura console (refer to xref:new-console.adoc[New Neo4j Aura console] for comparison), you can migrate the metadata from Workspace to the new console and continue working with your data in the new experience.
The metadata includes the data model and saved Cypher queries.
//Add Perspectives and Scenes when they are available.

== Data model

From the *Import* tab in Workspace, open the more menu (*...*) and download the model, with or without data.

Then navigate to the new console and select *Import* -> *Graph models*.
Once you select *New graph model*, you access the more menu (*...*), similar to Workspace, and select *Open model* with or without data.

Note that if you have downloaded your data with the model, you can also go a different route via *Import* -> *Data sources* and select *New data source* and then import locally from files.
This leads you to the same *Import* frame as the first route and you can use the more menu (*...*) to open the model *with* your data.

== Saved Cypher

Any saved Cypher snippets can be downloaded from the *Query* tab in Workspace.
From the Saved Cypher drawer, use the *Export* button to download selected queries as a _.csv_ file.

In the new console, navigate to the *Query* tab and open the  *Saved Cypher* drawer.
Use the *Import* button and select the _.csv_ file you downloaded from Workspace.

== Perspectives

Perspectives, except for the default Perspective (which is automatically re-created in the new console), can be exported from the Perspective drawer in Workspace.
Use the *Export* option on the Perspective you want to save.
It is exported as a _.json_ file.
