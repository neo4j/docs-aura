:description: This page describes how to create an instance in the new Neo4j Aura console.
:page-aliases: auradb/getting-started/create-database.adoc, aurads/create-instance.adoc

There are two types of Aura product instances:

* **AuraDB** (the default Aura instance type)
* **AuraDS** (the xref:graph-analytics/index.adoc#aura-ds[fully managed version] of Neo4j Graph Data Science)

Select the type of instance using the switch on the top right, then choose the tier that best suits your needs.

For AuraDB, you can upgrade your tier, and resize your instance's memory and storage later if your needs change.
For pre-paid AuraDB instances on GCP, adjustable storage independent of memory is available, see xref:managing-instances/instance-actions.adoc#_adjust_storage[Adjust storage] for more information.

You can optionally enable additional features:

* xref:graph-analytics/index.adoc#aura-gds-plugin[Graph Analytics plugin] to add graph analytics capabilities (**AuraDB Professional only**)
* xref:managing-instances/instance-details.adoc#aura-vector-optimization[Vector optimization] to enhance performance for vector-based operations

After selecting **Next**, your instance is created.
A password is generated for the instance, ensure to either copy or download it, as it will **not** be recoverable after.
The password is required to access your instance later.

[NOTE]
====
You can only create **one Free instance** per account.
To create more instances, you need to upgrade your tier.
See link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/[Neo4j Pricing] for more information on the different tiers.

== Connection method

To connect to an instance, select one of the following connection methods: *neo4j+s://* or *https://*

The connection method protocol is used for the communication between the Neo4j database server and the client application or tool.
For more information about connection schemes, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/connectors/[Operations Manual -> Configure network connectors] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/bolt/[Bolt Protocol].

=== *neo4j+s://*

Establishes a TLS-encrypted connection to Neo4j using the Bolt protocol over WebSockets, with full certificate validation. 
Use for optimal performance.

=== *https://*

TLS encrypted connection to Neo4j over HTTPS (Query API), with full certificate validation. 
Use in environments where port restrictions may prevent access to the Bolt port.

== Errors 

In an enterprise environment with restrictive networking, connection errors are sometimes caused because non-standard ports (like the Bolt protocol) are blocked by firewalls when using *neo4j+s://*.

Switching to *https://* can address connection issues and ensure seamless connectivity without extra configuration.
