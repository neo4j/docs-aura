The _Perspective_ is the business view, or the context, of the graph to which Explore connects.
The Perspective drawer is used to select or define this business view or context, before graph exploration can begin.
The business context set in the Perspective controls everything available in the Explore tool, e.g. what nodes and relationships that should be accessible, how they get categorized and styled, and what details about them can be seen or changed.
Perspectives are discussed in detail in xref::/explore/explore-perspectives/index.adoc[Perspectives].
