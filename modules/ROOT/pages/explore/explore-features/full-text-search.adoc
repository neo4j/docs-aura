= Full-text search

Explore allows users to always run a full-text search query against the database for their search input.
This is useful when suggestions provided by Explore do not satisfy the user’s need.
Full-text search using the input is the last suggestion provided to the user in the suggestions list.

Explore can take advantage of native full text indexes in the database.
Additionally, for small graphs with low cardinality in data values (e.g. the Movies graph), Explore is able to search in property values without requiring an explicit index.
The full text string entered by the user is searched as one unit for these cases.

[NOTE]
====
Full-text searching can be a time-consuming operation.
Depending on the database, the state of indexes, and the search input requested, you may have a noticeable lag in response time because the queries may take a long time to return.
That's why full-text search is kept as the last option in the suggestions list, to avoid unintentional use.

[WARNING]
====
When there is a delay in getting the search suggestions to return, the full-text search is the only option available to the user in the suggestions list.
It is recommended not to use the full-text search suggestion inadvertently.
The user may have to wait for a long time before results are returned and the full-text search can put a slightly larger workload on the database server.
