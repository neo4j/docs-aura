:description: This section describes how to provide files for import using Neo4j Data Importer.

In essence, you provide a set of files that contain the data to be imported and Data Importer imports them into Neo4j.

Data Importer supports flat files, i.e. files that contain data in a tabular format where each row represents a record and each column represents a field in that record.
The most common format for such files is CSV (comma-separated values), but Data Importer also supports TSV (tab-separated values).

Data Importer requires all files to have a header row and at least one row of data.
The header row speficies how the data in the file should be interpreted and contains information for each field.
For more information about CSV files and the header format, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import/#import-tool-header-format[Operations Manual -> CSV header format].
Keep in mind that the column names must be unique, i.e. it is not possible to have two columns with the same name within the same file.

The files are provided in the _Files_ panel of Data Importer.
You can browse for them or drag and drop them into the panel.
Once a file is added to the panel, you can preview the header and the first row of data in the file by expanding the file.

When you provide files to Data Importer, they are temporarily stored on the client side until you run the import.
If you reload the page before running the import, the files are no longer available to the page and you need to provide them again.
This is due to security features of your browser.
