== Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm/yarn

== Installation

Use the following command to install the Neo4j JavaScript Driver using npm:

[source, shell]
----
npm install neo4j-driver
----

Use the following command to install the Neo4j JavaScript Driver using yarn:

[source, shell]
----
yarn add neo4j-driver
----

== Code example

[source, javascript]

(async() => {
    const neo4j = require('neo4j-driver');

    const uri = 'neo4j+s://<Bolt url for Neo4j Aura instance>';
    const user = '<Username for Neo4j Aura instance>';
    const password = '<Password for Neo4j Aura instance>';
    
    // To learn more about the driver: https://neo4j.com/docs/javascript-manual/current/client-applications/#js-driver-driver-object
    const driver = neo4j.driver(uri, neo4j.auth.basic(user, password));

    try {
        const person1Name = 'Alice';
        const person2Name = 'David';

        await createFriendship(driver, person1Name, person2Name);

    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Something went wrong: ${error}`);
    } finally {

                                RETURN p1, p2`;

            // Write transactions allow the driver to handle retries and transient errors.
            const writeResult = await session.writeTransaction(tx =>
                tx.run(writeQuery, { person1Name, person2Name })
            );

            // Check the write results.
            writeResult.records.forEach(record => {
                const person1Node = record.get('p1');
                const person2Node = record.get('p2');
                console.info(`Created friendship between: ${person1Node.properties.name}, ${person2Node.properties.name}`);
            });

        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Something went wrong: ${error}`);
        } finally {
            // Close down the session if you're not using it anymore.
            await session.close();
        }
    }

    async function findPerson(driver, personName) {

        const session = driver.session({ database: 'neo4j' });

        try {
            const readQuery = `MATCH (p:Person)
                            WHERE p.name = $personName
                            RETURN p.name AS name`;

                tx.run(readQuery, { personName })

=== Running the example

Follow the steps below to run the example code:

. Copy and paste the code above into a file named `example.js`.
. Enter the information for the AuraDB instance you want to connect to by replacing:
* `<Bolt url for Neo4j Aura instance>` with the URI.
* `<Username for Neo4j Aura instance>` with the username.
* `<Password for Neo4j Aura instance>` with the password.
. Use the following command to run the example code:
+
[source, shell]
----
node example.js
----

=== Example walkthrough

The example imports `neo4j-driver` to connect to the Neo4j AuraDB instance.

Two functions are then called:

- `createFriendship` creates two `_Person_` nodes and a `_KNOWS_` relationship between them using a write transaction.
- `findPerson` finds the `_Person_` nodes using a read transaction.

[NOTE]
====
Developing with Neo4j Aura requires the use of https://neo4j.com/docs/javascript-manual/current/session-api/#js-driver-async-transaction-fn[Transaction Functions]. Transaction Functions enable automatic recovery from transient network errors and enable load balancing.
====

Make sure to log queries and data sent from your application as it is useful when you encounter errors and can help with debugging.
