:description: This section covers how to use drivers and libraries to connect your application to AuraDB.

You can use the official drivers and libraries provided by Neo4j to connect your application to AuraDB using a variety of programming languages. 

You can find instructions and example code for each driver/library below:

* xref:auradb/connecting-applications/python.adoc[]
* xref:auradb/connecting-applications/javascript.adoc[]
* xref:auradb/connecting-applications/graphql.adoc[]
* xref:auradb/connecting-applications/java.adoc[]
* xref:auradb/connecting-applications/spring-boot.adoc[]
* xref:auradb/connecting-applications/dotnet.adoc[]
* xref:auradb/connecting-applications/go.adoc[]

These instructions also appear within the https://console.neo4j.io/#how-to-connect[Connect section] of the Console and *CONNECT* tab of a database.

When accessing the *Connect* section from the sidebar menu of the Console, you can select from a list of available AuraDB databases. 
Once you select a database from the dropdown, the `uri` variable within the code samples populates accordingly.

When accessing the *CONNECT* tab within a database, the code samples populate the `uri` variable for the given database.
