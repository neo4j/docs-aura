:description: This page describes how to connect your application to AuraDB using the Java Driver.

== Prerequisites

- Java 17+

[NOTE]
====
The Java Driver 5.x series requires Java 17+ and the Java Driver 4.4 LTS requires Java 1.8+. This example uses the Java Driver 5.x series.
====

== Installation

Download the latest version of the Neo4j Java Driver along with the compatible version of Reactive Streams into your working directory.

To download the latest version of the Neo4j Java Driver:

. Navigate to the https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.neo4j.driver/neo4j-java-driver-all[Neo4j Java Driver page] of Maven Central.
. Select the latest version at the top of the list.
. Select *Downloads* from the top right of the page and then select *jar* to download the jar file.

To download the compatible version of Reactive Streams:

. Navigate to the Maven Central page of the version of the Neo4j Java Driver you previously downloaded.
. Find the `reactive-streams` artifact dependency in the pom.xml file on the left side of the page to find the version.
. Navigate to the https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.reactivestreams/reactive-streams[Reactive Streams page] of Maven Central.
. Select the same version as the one present in the pom.xml file previously.
. Select *Downloads* from the top right of the page and then select *jar* to download the jar file.

=== Running the example

Follow the steps below to run the example code:

. Copy and paste the code above into a file named `DriverIntroductionExample.java`.
. Enter the information for the AuraDB instance you want to connect to by replacing:
* `<Bolt url for Neo4j Aura instance>` with the URI.
* `<Username for Neo4j Aura instance>` with the username.
* `<Password for Neo4j Aura instance>` with the password.
. Use the following command to compile the java file, replacing `<driver-version>` with your installed driver version:
+
[source, shell]
----
javac -cp neo4j-java-driver-all-<driver-version>.jar DriverIntroductionExample.java
----
+
. Use the following command to run the example code, replacing `<driver-version>` with your installed driver version and `<rs-version>` with your installed Reactive Streams version:
+
[source, shell]
----
java -cp neo4j-java-driver-all-<driver-version>.jar:reactive-streams-<rs-version>.jar:. DriverIntroductionExample
----

=== Example walkthrough

The example imports `neo4j.driver` to connect to the Neo4j AuraDB instance.

The `main` function calls the following two functions:

- `createFriendship` creates two 'Person' nodes, Alice and David, and a 'KNOWS' relationship between them using a write transaction.
- `findPerson` finds Alice using a read transaction.

[NOTE]
====
Developing with Neo4j Aura requires the handling of transient errors and retry management. One of the ways you can meet this requirement is by using link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/java-manual/current/session-api/#java-driver-simple-transaction-fn[Transaction Functions].
====

Make sure to log queries and data sent from your application as it is useful when you encounter errors and can help with debugging.
