:page-aliases: connecting-applications/overview.adoc

You can use the official link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/create-applications/[drivers and libraries] provided by Neo4j to connect your application to AuraDB using a variety of programming languages.

Regardless of what language you use, you will need to provide the following information to connect to an AuraDB instance:

* `uri` - The *Connection URI* for your AuraDB instance.
You can copy this from the instance card or details page in the Console.
* `username` and `password` - The *Username* and *Password* for your AuraDB instance.
You can copy or download these during the instance creation process.
