:description: This page describes how to connect your application to AuraDB using the Neo4j Python Driver.

== Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 and above

== Installation

Use the following command to install the Neo4j Python Driver using pip:

[source, shell]
----
pip install neo4j
----

== Code example

[source, python]
----
import logging

from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j.exceptions import Neo4jError

class App:

    def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

    def close(self):
        # Don't forget to close the driver connection when you are finished with it
        self.driver.close()

    def create_friendship(self, person1_name, person2_name):
        with self.driver.session(database="neo4j") as session:
            # Write transactions allow the driver to handle retries and transient errors
            result = session.write_transaction(
                self._create_and_return_friendship, person1_name, person2_name)
            for record in result:
                print("Created friendship between: {p1}, {p2}"
                      .format(p1=record['p1'], p2=record['p2']))

    @staticmethod
    def _create_and_return_friendship(tx, person1_name, person2_name):
        # To learn more about the Cypher syntax, see https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/
        # The Reference Card is also a good resource for keywords https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/
        query = (
            "CREATE (p1:Person { name: $person1_name }) "
            "CREATE (p2:Person { name: $person2_name }) "
            "CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]->(p2) "
            "RETURN p1, p2"
        )
        result = tx.run(query, person1_name=person1_name, person2_name=person2_name)
        try:
            return [{"p1": record["p1"]["name"], "p2": record["p2"]["name"]}
                    for record in result]
        # Capture any errors along with the query and data for traceability
        except Neo4jError as exception:
            logging.error("{query} raised an error: \n {exception}".format(
                query=query, exception=exception))
            raise

    def find_person(self, person_name):
        with self.driver.session(database="neo4j") as session:
            result = session.read_transaction(self._find_and_return_person, person_name)
            for record in result:
                print("Found person: {record}".format(record=record))

    @staticmethod
    def _find_and_return_person(tx, person_name):
        query = (
            "MATCH (p:Person) "
            "WHERE p.name = $person_name "
            "RETURN p.name AS name"
        )
        result = tx.run(query, person_name=person_name)
        return [record["name"] for record in result]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Aura queries use an encrypted connection using the "neo4j+s" URI scheme
    uri = "neo4j+s://<Bolt url for Neo4j Aura instance>"
    user = "<Username for Neo4j Aura instance>"
    password = "<Password for Neo4j Aura instance>"
    app = App(uri, user, password)
    app.create_friendship("Alice", "David")
    app.find_person("Alice")
    app.close()
----

=== Running the example

Follow the steps below to run the example code:

. Copy and paste the code above into a file named `example.py`:
. Enter the information for the AuraDB instance you want to connect to by replacing:
* `<Bolt url for Neo4j Aura instance>` with the URI.
* `<Username for Neo4j Aura instance>` with the username.
* `<Password for Neo4j Aura instance>` with the password.
. Use the following command to run the example code:
+
[source, shell]
----
python example.py
----

=== Example walkthrough

The example imports `GraphDatabase` and `basic_auth` to connect to the Neo4j AuraDB instance and `ServiceUnavailable` for error handling.

The `Main` function calls the following two functions:

- `create_friendship` creates two 'Person' nodes, Alice and David, and a 'KNOWS' relationship between them using a write transaction.
- `find_person` finds Alice using a read transaction.

[NOTE]
====
Developing with Neo4j Aura requires the use of https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/session-api/#python-driver-simple-transaction-fn[Transaction Functions]. Transaction Functions enable automatic recovery from transient network errors and enable load balancing.
====

Make sure to log queries and data sent from your application as it is useful when you encounter errors and can help with debugging.
