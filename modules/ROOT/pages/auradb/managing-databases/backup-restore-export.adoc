= Backup, export and restore
:description: This page describes how to backup, export and restore your data from a snapshot.

The data in your AuraDB instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots.

A snapshot is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

The *Snapshots* tab within an AuraDB instance shows a list of available snapshots. footnote:[Snapshots are kept in the system for 7 days for Free and Professional plans and 90 days for Enterprise plans. Only the latest snapshot is available for Free instances.]

To access the *Snapshots* tab:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/?product=aura-db[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the instance you want to access.
. Select the *Snapshots* tab.

== Snapshot types

There are three different types of snapshot:

* label:AuraDB-Professional[] label:AuraDB-Enterprise[] *Scheduled* - Runs when you first create an instance, when changes to the underlying system occur (for example, a new patch release), and automatically at a cadence depending on your plan type.
footnote:[Automatic scheduled snapshots run once a day for Professional instances and once an hour for Enterprise instances.] 
* label:AuraDB-Professional[] label:AuraDB-Enterprise[] *Load* - Runs when you load a dump file from the *Import Database* tab of a instance and when you run the `push-to-cloud` command from the *Import* section of the sidebar menu of the Aura Console.
* *On-demand* - Runs when you select *Take snapshot* from the *Snapshots* tab of an instance.

== Snapshot actions

=== Backup and Export

You can use any of the *Scheduled* snapshots as a backup or manually trigger an *On-demand* snapshot by selecting *Take snapshot*.

By selecting the ellipses (*...*) button next to a snapshot, you can:

* *Export* - Download the instance as *_.dump_* file, allowing you to store a local copy and work on your data offline.
* *Create instance from snapshot* - Create a new AuraDB instance using the data from the snapshot.

=== Restore

You can restore data in your instance to a previous snapshot by selecting *Restore* next to the snapshot you want to restore.

Restoring a snapshot requires you to confirm the action by typing RESTORE and selecting *Restore*. 

[CAUTION]
====
Restoring a snapshot overwrites the data in your instance, replacing it with the data contained in the snapshot.
