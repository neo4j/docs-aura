= Backup, export and restore
:description: This page describes how to backup, export and restore your data from a snapshot.

The data in your AuraDB instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots.

A snapshot is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

The *Snapshots* tab within an AuraDB instance shows a list of available snapshots.

To access the *Snapshots* tab:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/?product=aura-db[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the instance you want to access.
. Select the *Snapshots* tab.

[NOTE]
====
Snapshots are kept in the system forÂ 7 days for Professional instances, and 60 days for Enterprise instances. 
Only the latest snapshot is available for Free instances.
====

== Snapshot types

=== Scheduled

label:AuraDB-Professional[]
label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]

A *Scheduled* snapshot is a snapshot that is automatically triggered when you first create an instance, when changes to the underlying system occur (for example, a new patch release), and at a cadence depending on your plan type.

Scheduled snapshots are run automatically once a day for Professional instances and once an hour for Enterprise instances. 
Only one scheduled snapshot is retained per day after 7 days for Enterprise instances.

[NOTE]
====
For AuraDB Enterprise database instances running Neo4j v4.x, from day 0 to 7 scheduled snapshots run automatically once every 6 hours. 
From day 8 to 60, snapshots run once a day.
====

=== Load

label:AuraDB-Professional[]
label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]

A *Load* snapshot is a snapshot that is automatically triggered when you load a dump file from the *Import Database* tab of an instance or when you run the xref:auradb/importing/import-database.adoc#_neo4j_admin_database_upload[Neo4j Admin `database upload` command].

=== On Demand

An *On Demand* snapshot is a snapshot that you manually trigger by selecting *Take snapshot* from the *Snapshots* tab of an instance.

== Snapshot actions

=== Restore

[CAUTION]
====
Restoring a snapshot overwrites the data in your instance, replacing it with the data contained in the snapshot.
====

You can restore data in your instance to a previous snapshot by selecting *Restore* next to the snapshot you want to restore.

Restoring a snapshot requires you to confirm the action by typing RESTORE and selecting *Restore*.

=== Export/Create

By selecting the ellipses (*...*) button next to an existing snapshot, you can:

* *Export* - Download the instance as *_.dump_* file, allowing you to store a local copy and work on your data offline.
* *Create instance from snapshot* - Create a new AuraDB instance using the data from the snapshot.

[NOTE]
====
The ability to Export or Create an instance from a Scheduled Enterprise snapshot is limited to 14 days.

Additionally, for Enterprise instances running Neo4j version 5, the ability to export or create an instance from a Scheduled snapshot is limited to the first full snapshot, taken once per day.
