:description: This section describes custom endpoints.

Custom endpoints can be used for database management and migration.

You can create custom endpoints for your instances directly from the console.
This allows you to establish connection to a database using this endpoint instead of the `<dbid>`.

Use the *...* button on the instance card to set a custom endpoint.
Choose an appropriate name for the endpoint.
It can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
