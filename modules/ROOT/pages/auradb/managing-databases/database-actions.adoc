= Database actions
:description: This page describes how to resize, clone, pause, resume, delete and rename an AuraDB database.

You can perform several database actions from an AuraDB database card on the https://console.neo4j.io/?product=aura-db[Neo4j Aura Console] homepage.

== Renaming a database

You can change the name of an existing database by using the *Rename* action.

To rename a database:

. Select the ellipsis (*...*) button on the database you want to rename.
. Select *Rename* from the resulting menu.
. Enter a new name for the database.
. Select *Rename*.

== Resizing a database

label:AuraDB-Professional[]
label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]

You can change the size of an existing database by using the *Resize* action.

To resize a database:

. Select the ellipsis (*...*) button on the database you want to resize.
. Select *Resize* from the resulting menu.
. Select the new size you want your database to be.
. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Submit*.

A database remains available during the resize operation.

== Pausing a database

[NOTE]
====
You cannot manually pause an AuraDB Free database; they are paused automatically after 72 hours of inactivity. footnote:[Inactivity is when you perform no queries on the database.]
====

label:AuraDB-Professional[]
label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]

You can pause a database during periods you don't need it and resume it at any time.

To pause a database:

. Select the pause button on the database you want to pause.
. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Pause* to confirm.

After confirming, the database begins pausing, and a play button replaces the pause button.

[NOTE]
====
Paused databases run at a discounted rate compared to standard consumption, as outlined in the confirmation window.
You can pause a database for up to 30 days, after which point AuraDB automatically resumes the database.

=== Resuming a paused database

To resume a database: 

. Select the play button on the database you want to pause.
. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Resume* to confirm.

After confirming, the database begins resuming, which may take a few minutes.

[WARNING]
====
AuraDB Free databases do not automatically resume after 30 days. If an AuraDB Free database remains paused for more than 90 days, Aura deletes the database, and all information is lost.
