. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Upgrade Instance*.

=== Upgrade from Professional to Business Critical

You can upgrade an AuraDB Professional instance to an AuraDB Business Critical instance using the *Upgrade to Business Critical* action.

Upgrading your instance clones your Professional instance data to a new Business Critical instance, leaving your existing Professional instance untouched.

To upgrade a Business Critical instance:

. Select the ellipsis (*...*) button on the free instance you want to upgrade.
. Select *Upgrade to Business Critical*.
. Set your desired settings for the new instance.

== Resize an instance

label:AuraDB-Professional[]
label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]
label:AuraDB-Business-Critical[]

You can change the size of an existing instance using the *Resize* action.

To resize an instance:

. Select the ellipsis (*...*) button on the instance you want to resize.
. Select *Resize* from the resulting menu.
. Select the new size you want your instance to be.
. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Upgrade instance*.

An instance remains available during the resize operation.

== Pause an instance

label:AuraDB-Professional[]
label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]
label:AuraDB-Business-Critical[]

[NOTE]
====
You cannot manually pause an AuraDB Free instance; they are paused automatically after 72 hours of inactivity. footnote:[Inactivity is when you perform no queries on the instance.]
====

You can pause an instance when not needed and resume it at any time.

To pause an instance:

. Select the pause button on the instance you want to pause.
. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Pause* to confirm.

After confirming, the instance begins pausing, and a play button replaces the pause button.

[NOTE]
====
Paused instances run at a discounted rate compared to standard consumption, as outlined in the confirmation window.
You can pause an instance for up to 30 days, after which point AuraDB automatically resumes the instance.
====

=== Resume a paused instance

To resume an instance:

. Select the play button on the instance you want to pause.
. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Resume* to confirm.

After confirming, the instance begins resuming, which may take a few minutes.

[WARNING]
====
AuraDB Free instances do not automatically resume after 30 days. If an AuraDB Free instance remains paused for more than 30 days, Aura deletes the instance, and all information is lost.
====

== Clone an instance

You can clone an existing instance to create a new instance with the same data.
You can clone across regions, from AuraDB to AuraDS and vice versa, and from Neo4j version 4 to Neo4j version 5.

There are four options to clone an instance:

* Clone to a new AuraDB instance
* Clone to an existing AuraDB instance
* Clone to a new AuraDS database
* Clone to an existing AuraDS database

You can access all the cloning options from the ellipsis (*...*) button on the AuraDB instance.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot clone from a Neo4j version 5 instance to a Neo4j version 4 instance.
