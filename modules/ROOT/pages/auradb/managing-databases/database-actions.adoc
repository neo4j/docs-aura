= Instance actions
:description: This page describes the following instance actions - rename, resest, upgrade, resize, pause, resume, clone to a new database, clone to an existing database, or delete and instance.

Perform multiple instance actions directly from an instance card: Pause/resume, develop, view instance details, clone to new instance/clone to existing instance, edit secondaries, delete, resize, view resources/view all metrics.

== Instance details

From the instance card, you can select the more actions (*...*) button then select *instance details*.
From the instance details you can rename an instance, view instance details and we explain them in the instance actions docs.

// To reset an instance:

// == Upgrade an instance

// === Upgrade from Free to Professional

// You can upgrade an AuraDB Free instance to an AuraDB Professional instance using the *Upgrade to Professional* action.

// Upgrading your instance clones your Free instance data to a new Professional instance, leaving your existing Free instance untouched.

// To upgrade a Free instance:

// . Select the ellipsis (*...*) button on the free instance you want to upgrade.
// . Select *Upgrade to Professional* from the resulting menu.
// . Set your desired settings for the new instance. For more information on AuraDB instance creation settings, see xref:auradb/getting-started/create-database.adoc[].
// . Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Upgrade Instance*.

// === Upgrade from Professional to Business Critical

// You can upgrade an AuraDB Professional instance to an AuraDB Business Critical instance using the *Upgrade to Business Critical* action.

// Upgrading your instance clones your Professional instance data to a new Business Critical instance, leaving your existing Professional instance untouched.

// To upgrade a Business Critical instance:

// . Select the ellipsis (*...*) button on the free instance you want to upgrade.
// . Select *Upgrade to Business Critical*.
// . Set your desired settings for the new instance. 
// For more information on AuraDB instance creation settings, see xref:auradb/getting-started/create-database.adoc[].
// . Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Upgrade Instance*.

== Resize an instance

Resizing an instance means changing the Memory, CPU and storage size. 

// label:AuraDB-Professional[]
// label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]
// label:AuraDB-Business-Critical[]

You can change the size of an existing instance using the *Resize* action.

To resize an instance:

. Select the *resize* button on the instance you want to resize.
. Select *Resize* from the resulting menu.
. Select the new size you want your instance to be.
. Tick the *I accept* checkbox and select *Resize*.

An instance remains available during the resize operation.

== Pause an instance

Pausing a Neo4j instance temporarily stops the database, which means:

* No Access to Data: The data stored in the database becomes inaccessible. 
Any applications or users trying to connect to the instance won't be able to run queries or retrieve data until the instance is resumed.

* No Processing: The database won't process any operations or transactions while it's paused. 
Any ongoing operations will be halted.

* Data is Preserved: Your data remains safe and unchanged while the instance is paused. 
When you resume the instance, you can pick up right where you left off.

Pausing is like putting the database on hold without shutting it down completely, so you can restart it quickly when needed.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot manually pause an AuraDB Free instance; they are paused automatically after 72 hours of inactivity. footnote:[Inactivity is when you perform no queries on the instance.]
====

You can pause an instance when not needed and resume it at any time.

To pause an instance:

. Select the pause button on the instance you want to pause.
. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Pause* to confirm.

After confirming, the instance begins pausing, and a play button replaces the pause button.

[NOTE]
====
Paused instances run at a discounted rate compared to standard consumption, as outlined in the confirmation window.
You can pause an instance for up to 30 days, after which point AuraDB automatically resumes the instance.
====

=== Resume a paused instance

To resume an instance:

. Select the play button on the instance you want to pause.
. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Resume* to confirm.

After confirming, the instance begins resuming, which may take a few minutes.

[WARNING]
====
AuraDB Free instances do not automatically resume after 30 days. If an AuraDB Free instance remains paused for more than 30 days, Aura deletes the instance, and all information is lost.
====

== Clone an instance

You can clone an existing instance to create a new instance with the same data.
You can clone across regions, and from Neo4j version 4 to Neo4j version 5.

There are two options to clone an instance:

* Clone to a new instance
* Clone to an existing instance

You can access all the cloning options from the ellipsis (*...*) button on the instance.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot clone from a Neo4j version 5 instance to a Neo4j version 4 instance.
====

=== Clone to a new instance

. Select the ellipsis (*...*) button on the instance you want to clone.
. Select *Clone To New* from the contextual menu.
. Set your desired settings for the new database. For more information on AuraDB database creation, see xref:auradb/getting-started/create-database.adoc[].
. Check the *I understand* box and select *Clone Database*.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure that the username and password are stored safely before continuing.
Credentials cannot be recovered afterwards.
====

=== Clone to an existing instance

When you clone an instance to an existing instance, the database connection URI stays the same, but the data is replaced with the data from the cloned instance.

[WARNING]
====
Cloning into an existing instance will replace all existing data.
If you want to keep the current data, take a snapshot and export it.
====

. Select the ellipsis (*...*) button on the instance you want to clone.
. Select *Clone To Existing* and then *AuraDB* from the contextual menu.
. If necessary, change the database name.
. Select the existing AuraDB database to clone to from the dropdown menu.
+
[NOTE]
====
Existing instances that are not large enough to clone into will not be available for selection.
In the dropdown menu, they will be grayed out and have the string `(Instance is not large enough to clone into)` appended to their name.
====
+
. Check the *I understand* box and select *Clone*.
