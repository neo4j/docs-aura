:description: This page describes the instance details.

The "Develop" button in Neo4j is your gateway to a wealth of resources tailored for developers. From the Aura console, you can select your preferred programming language and access all relevant documentation directly within the UI, as well as link out to our extensive external docs. While these resources are comprehensive and detailed, they can be complex, especially if you're not a developer.

For those who simply want to explore and visualize their data without diving into development, the Neo4j console offers a user-friendly environment to interact with your data, making it easy to focus on what matters mostâ€”your data's insights and patterns.

* Connects to drivers manuals
