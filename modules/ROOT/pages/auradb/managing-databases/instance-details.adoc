== Snapshots

Snapshots are backups of your data. 

The data in your instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots. 
A snapshot is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

Neo4j regularly takes snapshots of your instance, and you can request a snapshot to be taken on demand.
 
These snapshots can be used to restore data to a different Neo4j instance.
