== Snapshots

Snapshots are backups of your data. 
The data in your instance can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots. 
A snapshot is a copy of the data in an instance at a specific point in time.

Neo4j regularly takes snapshots of your instance, and you can request a snapshot to be taken on demand.
These snapshots can be used to restore data to a different Neo4j instance.

== Logs

If something goes wrong, the logs are a good place to start. 
The standard log is called `neo4j.log` and it contains general information about Neo4j. 
There is one for each DBMS and it can be accessed directly from Desktop via the Developer menu. It opens in a separate window, which allows you to keep it in the background.
