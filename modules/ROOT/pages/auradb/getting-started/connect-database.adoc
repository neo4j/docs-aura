= Connect to an instance
:description: This page describes how to connect to an instance using Neo4j AuraDB.

To start using the data within an instance, you'll need to connect to it. 

There are a few different ways to connect to an instance.
You'll need the passwords / info you downloaded when you created the instance.

== Choose connection method

All you need to worry about is having the correct URI and password. It was in that file you downloaded!

|Protocol
|Don't worry about this and just use the default if you are a new user of Aura. Protocols are mainly for server-side routing vs client-side routing. We've seperated protocol and connection URL. The main reason for this, is being able to change these things independently. Users may want to use different protocols for the same instance URL, for example they get client-side routing with neo4j+s (better for clusters and single servers) or have a direct connection to the instance using bolt+s (not the default as it's less flexible).

|Connection URL 
|You can get this from your instance details 

|Database user 
|Neo4j by default

|Password 
|You are given the password when you initially create the instance

|Single sign-on 
|If this is set up, you can use SSO.
