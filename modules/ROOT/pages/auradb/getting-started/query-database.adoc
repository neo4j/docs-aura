:page-aliases: query/introduction.adoc

You can query data in an AuraDB instance using Cypher.

Cypher is the declarative graph query language created by Neo4j and can be used to query, update, and administer your AuraDB instance.

You can run Cypher statements through Neo4j Browser and Neo4j Cypher Shell.
For more information on how to open an AuraDB instance in Browser and Cypher Shell, see xref:auradb/getting-started/connect-database.adoc[].

For more information on Cypher and Aura, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/introduction/cypher_aura/[the Neo4j Cypher Manual].
