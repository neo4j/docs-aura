This page describes the various ways you can get data into a Neo4j AuraDB database.

[NOTE]
====
*Note:* The process of importing or loading data requires you to xref:auradb/getting-started/create-database.adoc[create an AuraDB database] beforehand. 
====

If you have data in an existing Neo4j database, you can follow the instructions in <<_importing_an_existing_neo4j_database>>.

If your data exists outside of Neo4j as a *_.csv_* file, you can follow the instructions in <<_loading_csv_data>>.

== Importing an existing Neo4j database

There are two ways you can import data from an existing Neo4j database into an AuraDB database.

The easiest way is to export a Neo4j database as a *_.dump_* file and use the <<_import_database>> process.
This process, however, only works for *_.dump_* files under 4GB. 

If the size of the *_.dump_* file exported from a database is greater than 4GB, you must use the <<_push_to_cloud>> method.

=== Import database

To import a *_.dump_* file under 4GB:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the name of the database you want to import the data.
. Select the *IMPORT DATABASE* tab.
. Drag and drop your *_.dump_* file into the provided window or select *Select a .dump file* and select your file.
. Select *Upload*.

When the upload is complete, the database goes into a 'Loading' state as the dump is applied. 
Once this has finished, the database returns to its 'Running' state; and the data is ready.

=== Push-to-cloud

`Push-to-cloud` is a Neo4j Admin command that you can run to upload the contents of a Neo4j database into an AuraDB database, regardless of the database's size.

Details on how to use the command, along with a full list of options, can be found in the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin/push-to-cloud/[Neo4j Admin push-to-cloud documentation].

== Loading CSV data

You can load data from a *_.csv_* file into an AuraDB database with the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/load-csv/[`LOAD CSV`] Cypher statement within Neo4j Browser.
For instructions on how to open an AuraDB database with Neo4j Browser, see xref:auradb/getting-started/access-database.adoc[].

There are some limitations to consider when loading a *_.csv_* file into an AuraDB database:

* For security reasons, you must host your *_.csv_* file on a publicly accessible HTTP or HTTPS server. Examples of such servers include GitHub, Google Drive, and Dropbox.

* The `LOAD CSV` command is built to handle small to medium-sized data sets, such as anything up to 10 million nodes and relationships. You should avoid using this command for any data sets exceeding this limit.
