= Using the Query API with Aura
:description: Use the Query API with Aura to execute Cypher statements against a Neo4j server through HTTPS requests.

== Introduction

The Query API enables interaction with an Aura database using Cypher via HTTPS.

For more information, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/query-api/current/[Query API documentation] but note that:

* For Aura instances, the host follows the format `<databaseID>.databases.neo4j.io`

* The Query API documentation mainly refers to self-managed instances that use port `7474`, whereas Aura supports HTTPS only, which defaults to port `443` 

* As HTTPS implies port `443` in the request, you do not need to include the port in the URL.
