== Notes

Further details of the physical location can be found in Google's link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#locations[Regions and zones documentation]

To connect to Aura in your application, your URI will need to use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your AuraDB Instance, and not just the IP address.

For example, if your AuraDB Instance ID is `abcd1234`, then the URI to use would be `neo4j+s://abcd1234.databases.neo4j.io`

Ports 80 and 7474 are redirected to 443 for convenience but communication remains encrypted.
