= Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark
:description: This page describes how to connect to AuraDS using Spark.

WARNING: PAGE UNDER DEVELOPMENT

The Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark is intended to make integrating graphs with Spark easy. There are two ways to use the connector:

* As a https://neo4j.com/docs/spark/current/reading/[data source^]: read any set of nodes or relationships as a `DataFrame` in Spark
* As a https://neo4j.com/docs/spark/current/writing/[sink^]: write any `DataFrame` to Neo4j as a collection of nodes or relationships, or use a Cypher statement to process records contained in a `DataFrame` into the graph pattern of your choice

Connecting to AuraDS only requires to make a few changes to the https://neo4j.com/docs/spark/current/configuration/[Neo4j driver configuration^]:

. Replace the `bolt` URI (the value of the `neo4j.server.uri` configuration parameter) with the `neo4j+s://` connection URI from the AuraDS instance detail page
. Update the username and password configuration parameters as appropriate
