= Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark
:description: This page describes how to connect to AuraDS using Spark.

WARNING: PAGE UNDER DEVELOPMENT

The Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark is intended to make integrating graphs with Spark easy. There are effectively two ways of using the connector:

* As a data source: read any set of nodes or relationships as a DataFrame in Spark
* As a sink: write any DataFrame to Neo4j as a collection of nodes or relationships, or use a Cypher statement to process records contained in a DataFrame into the graph pattern of your choice.

For more information check the https://neo4j.com/docs/spark/current/[Neo4j Apache Spark Connector] page.
