== Updates and upgrades

AuraDS updates and upgrades are handled by the platform, and as such do not require user intervention. Security patches and new versions of GDS and Neo4j are installed within short time windows during which the affected instances are unavailable.

The operations are non-destructive, so graph projections, models and data present on an instance are not affected. No operation is applied until all the running GDS algorithms have finished.
