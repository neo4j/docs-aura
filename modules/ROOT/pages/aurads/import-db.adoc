== Importing an existing Neo4j database

There are two ways you can import data from an existing Neo4j database into an AuraDS instance.

The easiest way is to export a Neo4j database as a *_.dump_* file (as shown in the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/backup-restore/offline-backup/[operations manual]) and use the <<_import_database>> process.
This process, however, only works for *_.dump_* files under 4GB. If the size of the *_.dump_* file exported from a database is greater than 4GB, you must use the <<_push_to_cloud>> method.

=== Import database

To import a *_.dump_* file under 4GB:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/?product=aura-ds[Neo4j Aura Console^] in your browser.
. Select the instance you want to import the database to.
. Select the *Import Database* tab.
. Drag and drop your *_.dump_* file into the provided window, or click on *Select a _.dump_ file* and select your file.
. Select *Upload*.

When the upload is complete, the AuraDS instance goes into a `Loading` state as the dump is applied. 
Once this has finished, the instance returns to its `Running` state and the data is ready.

=== Push-to-cloud

`Push-to-cloud` is a Neo4j Admin command that you can run to upload the contents of a Neo4j database into an AuraDS instance, regardless of the database's size.

Instructions on running the command can be found by clicking on the *Click here* link in the *Import Database* tab or by navigating directly to the https://console.neo4j.io/?product=aura-ds#import-instructions[Neo4j Aura Console Import page^].

When prompted that the process is complete, the data is ready.
