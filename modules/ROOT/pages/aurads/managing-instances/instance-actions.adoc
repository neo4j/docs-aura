:description: This page describes the available actions for an AuraDS instance.

You can perform several actions from an AuraDS instance card on the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console^] homepage.

== Renaming an instance

You can change the name of an existing instance by using the *Rename* action.

To rename an instance:

. Select the ellipsis (*...*) button on the instance you want to rename.
. Select *Rename* from the resulting menu.
. Enter a new name for the instance.
. Select *Rename*.

== Resizing an instance

You can change the size of an existing instance by using the *Resize* action.

To resize an instance:

. Select the ellipsis (...) on the instance you want to resize.
. Select *Resize* from the resulting menu.
. Select the new size you want your instance to be.
. Tick the *I understand* checkbox and select *Submit*.

An instance becomes unavailable for a short period of time during the resize operation.

== Pausing an instance

You can pause an instance during periods where you don't need it and resume at any time.

To pause an instance:

. Select the pause icon on the instance you want to pause.
. Select *Pause* to confirm.

After confirming, the instance will begin pausing, and a *Resume* button will replace the *Pause* button.

[NOTE]
====
Paused instances run at a discounted rate compared to standard consumption, as outlined in the confirmation window.
You can pause an instance for up to 30 days, after which point AuraDS automatically resumes the instance.

To resume an instance: 

. Select the play icon on the instance you want to pause.
