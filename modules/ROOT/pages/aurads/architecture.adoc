AuraDS makes it easy to run graph algorithms on Neo4j by integrating two main components:

* *Neo4j Database*, where graph data are loaded and stored, and Cypher queries and all database operations (for example user management, query termination, etc.) are executed;
* *Graph Data Science*, a software component installed in the Neo4j Database, whose main purpose is to run graph algorithms on in-memory projections of Neo4j Database data.

== Graph Data Science concepts

Graph Data Science (GDS) includes procedures to project and manage graphs, run algorithms, and train machine learning models.

.Graph Catalog

The https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-catalog-ops/[graph catalog^] is used to store and manage projected graphs via GDS procedures.

.Algorithms

GDS contains many https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/operations-reference/algorithm-references/[graph algorithms^], invoked as Cypher procedures and run on projected graphs.

GDS algorithms are broken down into three tiers of maturity:

- *Alpha*: experimental algorithms that may be changed or removed at any time. Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.alpha.<algorithm>`.

- *Beta*: algorithms promoted from the Alpha tier to candidates for the Production tier. Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.beta.<algorithm>`.

- *Production*: algorithms that have been rigorously tested for stability and scalability. Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.<algorithm>`.

.Model Catalog

Some machine learning algorithms (for example Node Classification and GraphSage) need to use trained models in their computation. The https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/model-catalog/[model catalog^] is used to store and manage named trained models.

.Pipeline Catalog

The https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/pipeline-catalog/[pipeline catalog^] is used to manage machine learning pipelines. A pipeline groups together all the stages of a supported machine learning task (for example Node classification), from graph feature extraction to model training, in a single end-to-end workflow.

== Graph data flow

Since GDS algorithms can only run in memory, the typical data flow involves:

. Reading the graph data from Neo4j Database
. Loading (_projecting_) the data into an in-memory graph
. Running an algorithm on a projected graph
. Writing the results back to Neo4j Database (if the algorithm runs in xref:aurads/tutorials/algorithm-modes#_write[write] mode)
