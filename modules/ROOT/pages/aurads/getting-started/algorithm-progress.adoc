This brief tutorial can be followed within a Google Collab which is based on Jupyter notebooks.

Running algorithms on large graphs can be computationally expensive. As part of your workflow, you may want to chain algorithms together, inspect the progress of each step and potentially export the results to other systems or workflows.

Understanding when an algorithm has completed is especially useful in the above application.

In this tutorial, you will be shown how to use and interpret the `gds.beta.listProgress()` procedure, along with integrating it as part of your workflow.

For more information about https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/common-usage/logging/#logging-progress-logging[Progress Logging] head over to the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library manual.

== Driver Setup

For more information about getting started with the python driver, check out the previous tutorial https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10XK5_fyNURb1u_gvD_lkt7qQvIxzAhnJ#scrollTo=lLi0tbsaaWnH[here]

[source, python]
----
pip install neo4j
----

[source, python]
----
# Driver import
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# We'll use the json.dumps function later to prettify some results
import json

# Connection Details
# Aura queries use an encrypted connection using the "neo4j+s" URI scheme
AURA_CONNECTION_URI = "neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io"
AURA_USERNAME = "neo4j"
AURA_PASSWORD = ""

# Driver Instantiation
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(AURA_CONNECTION_URI, auth=(AURA_USERNAME, AURA_PASSWORD))
----

== Example Graph

We will use the graph generation function within the GDS Library to generate a random in-memory graph.

Our graph is going to be nodes with the label `1000000_Nodes` with a relationship of `POWER_LAW`

`(:1000000_Nodes)-[:POWER_LAW]->(:1000000_Nodes)`

You can read more about the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/graph-generation/#graph-generation[Graph Generation] procedure. This may take a minute or so to run.

[source, python]
----
# Cypher Query
create_example_graph_query = """
CALL gds.beta.graph.generate("example-graph", 10000000, 3, {relationshipDistribution: 'POWER_LAW'})
YIELD name, nodes, relationships, generateMillis, relationshipSeed, averageDegree, relationshipDistribution, relationshipProperty
RETURN *
"""

# Create driver session to the database
with driver.session() as session:
  # Run query
  result = session.run(create_example_graph_query).data()
  # prettify the first result
  print(json.dumps(result[0], indent=2, sort_keys=True))
----

== Checking progress Long running algorithms

We will need to start a long running algorithm that will take a little while to converge. For our example we'll try `Label Propagation` which will take some time.

In order to be able to start a long running query and inspect the progress we will use threading in this example.

[source, python]

# Imports to help us
import threading, time


# method to call label propagation on our example in memory graph
def run_label_prop():
label_prop_mutate_example_graph_query = """
CALL gds.labelPropagation.mutate("example-graph", { mutateProperty: 'communityID' } )
YIELD createMillis,
computeMillis,
mutateMillis,
postProcessingMillis,
nodePropertiesWritten,
communityCount,
ranIterations,
didConverge,
communityDistribution,
configuration
RETURN *
"""

# Create driver session to the database
with driver.session() as session:
  # Run query
  print('running label prop')
  results = session.run(label_prop_mutate_example_graph_query).data()
  # prettify the first result
  print(json.dumps(results[0], indent=2, sort_keys=True))


# method to call list progress which calls
def run_list_progress():
gds_list_progress_query = """
CALL gds.beta.listProgress()
YIELD id,
taskName,
message
RETURN *
"""

# Create driver session to the database
with driver.session() as session:
  # Run query
  print('running list progress')
  results = session.run(gds_list_progress_query).data()
  # prettify the first result
  print('list progress results: ')

  for result in results:
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2, sort_keys=True))


# create a thread for each of the cypher calls
label_prop_query_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_label_prop)
list_progress_query_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_list_progress)

# start the label propagation query
label_prop_query_thread.start()

# sleep for a few seconds so the label propagation query has time to get going
print('sleeping for 5 seconds')
time.sleep(5)
# start the list progress query
list_progress_query_thread.start()

# block and wait for the threads to finish
list_progress_query_thread.join()
label_prop_query_thread.join()

== Clean-up the tutorial

To drop the example in-memory graph we created previously, you can use the `gds.graph.drop` procedure and specify the name of the graph we created (example-graph).

https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-catalog-ops/#graph-catalog-ops[]

[source, python]
----
delete_example_in_memory_graph_query = """
CALL gds.graph.drop("example-graph")
"""

with driver.session() as session:
  # Run query
  results = session.run(delete_example_in_memory_graph_query).data()

  print(json.dumps(results[0], indent=2, sort_keys=True))
