:description: This page describes how to connect to AuraDS using the Python driver.

This brief tutorial can be followed along within a Google Collab which is based on Jupyter notebooks.

Within this tutorial, we'll give you some best practices for connecting and interacting with Neo4j and the Graph Data Science Library.

[NOTE]
For more information about the https://neo4j.com/docs/driver-manual/current/get-started[Python Driver], head over to the Neo4j Driver Manual.

== Install the Python Driver

To install the latest stable version of the Python Driver:

[source, shell]
----
pip install neo4j
----

To find the latest stable version of the Python Driver, visit https://pypi.org/project/neo4j/

== Importing the Driver

The main import you'll need is the `GraphDatabase` import. This will allow you to create a driver which we will use to connect to and run queries against the database.

[source, python]
----
# Driver import
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
----

== Connection Details

Connecting to your instance will need the three inputs:

* Database Connection URI
* Database Username
* Database Password

You will have been given the Database Username and Password when you created your database. Copy and paste these into each of the relevant fields labelled: `AURA_USERNAME` & `AURA_PASSWORD`.

You can find your database connection URI located on the database card under the Database section within Aura. Copy and paste this into the field labelled: `AURA_CONNECTION_URI`

image::connection.png[title="Connection"]

[source, python]
----
# Connection Details
AURA_ENDPOINT = "neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io"
AURA_USERNAME = "neo4j"
AURA_PASSWORD = ""
```
----

== Driver object

Constructing a driver instance requires the connection URI (`AURA_CONNECTION_URI`) and authentication information (`AURA_USERNAME` & `AURA_PASSWORD`).

We'll use the Driver object to create Sessions with the database, this will allow you to run Queries.

[source, python]
----
# Driver Instantiation
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(AURA_CONNECTION_URI, auth=(AURA_USERNAME, AURA_PASSWORD))
----

== Running a query

Below we'll run two example queries. The first will get the version of GDS running on the database. The second will ask GDS to list all the procedures available within the library and return the first 5

[source, python]
----
# Cypher Query
list_in_memory_graph_query = """
RETURN gds.version() AS version
"""

# Create a driver session
with driver.session() as session:
  # use .data() to access the results array
  results = session.run(list_in_memory_graph_query).data()
  print(results)
----

== Closing the Driver

When you're finished interacting with your instance, you should close your driver connection.

[source, python]
----
# Close the Driver connection
driver.close()
----
