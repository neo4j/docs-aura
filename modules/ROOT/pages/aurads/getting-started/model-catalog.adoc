:description: This page describes how to use the model catalog.

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fLhOiu54YgXXLR52V4DiR-oZN3_sRb54?usp=sharing[Play in Google Colab]

This brief tutorial can be followed within a Google Collab which is based on Jupyter notebooks.

Within this tutorial, we'll go through how you create, save, drop and reload a machine learning model.

For more information about the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/model-catalog/model-catalog/[Model Catalog], head over to the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library manual

== Driver Setup

For more information about getting started with the python driver, check out the previous tutorial https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10XK5_fyNURb1u_gvD_lkt7qQvIxzAhnJ#scrollTo=lLi0tbsaaWnH[here]

[source, python]
----
pip install neo4j
----

[source, python]
----
# Driver import
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# We'll use the json.dumps function later to prettify some results
import json

# Connection Details
# Aura queries use an encrypted connection using the "neo4j+s" URI scheme
AURA_CONNECTION_URI = "neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io"
AURA_USERNAME = "neo4j"
#AURA_PASSWORD = ""

# Driver Instantiation
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(AURA_CONNECTION_URI, auth=(AURA_USERNAME, AURA_PASSWORD))
----

== Example Graph

We're going to create a graph within the database to use in-memory and create our model from.

We'll delete this data later on in the tutorial.

[source, python]

== Loading our example data into memory

For more information about getting started with the in-memory graph, check out the previous tutorial https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fkER4UB0yvx_ctTV8PAhl_rPp6kDB0Px#scrollTo=MLW9u-jiTjfR[here]

  # prettify the first result

----

== Training our model

We're going to use graphSAGE to train our model. For more examples on how to train with multiple node labels and relationship weights, head over to the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/graph-sage/#algorithms-embeddings-graph-sage-examples[graphSAGE documentation] for more examples

  result = session.run(train_graph_sage_on_in_memory_graph_query).data()
  # prettify the first result
  print(json.dumps(result[0], indent=2, sort_keys=True))
----

== Viewing our model catalog

Calling `gds.beta.model.list()` will present information about the models that are currently available in the catalog.

We are provided information about the graph schema, the model name, training configuration but also the following pieces of key information:

* Loaded - Flag denoting if the Model is in memory (`true`) or available on disk (`false`)
* Stored - Flag denoting whether the Model has been persisted to disk
* Shared - Flag denoting whether the Model has been published, making it accessible to all users

[source, python]
----
# import for our helper function
from neo4j.time import DateTime

# helper function for serialising Neo4j DateTime in JSON dumps
def default(o):
   if isinstance(o, (DateTime)):
     return o.isoformat()

# Cypher Query
list_model_catalog_query  = """
CALL gds.beta.model.list()
"""

# Create driver session to the database
with driver.session() as session:
  # Run query
  results = session.run(list_model_catalog_query).data()

  # for each result prettify the results
  for result in results:
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2, sort_keys=True, default=default) + "\n\n")
----

== Saving to Model disk

Saving models to disk can be useful for a few reasons like making sure we have a copy we can go back to or freeing up space in memory.

To save a model, call the `gds.alpha.model.store` procedure with the name of the model you want to persist.

[source, python]
----
# Cypher Query
save_graph_sage_model_to_disk_query  = """
CALL gds.alpha.model.store("example_graph_model_for_graphsage")
"""

# Create driver session to the database
with driver.session() as session:
  # Run query
  result = session.run(save_graph_sage_model_to_disk_query).data()
  # prettify the first result
  print(json.dumps(result[0], indent=2, sort_keys=True))
----

If we list our model catalog again, we'll see that the stored flag has been set to `true`

[source, python]
----
# Create driver session to the database
with driver.session() as session:
  # Run query
  results = session.run(list_model_catalog_query).data()

  # for each result prettify the results
  for result in results:
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2, sort_keys=True, default=default) + "\n\n")
----

== Sharing the Model with other database users

Allowing multiple users access to analyse and execute either on the same datasets or with the same models is handy.

To do this we need to create another user, more information about the cypher syntax can be found https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/administration/security/users-and-roles/[here]

== Creating another database user

Within our database instance we can https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/administration/security/users-and-roles/#administration-security-users-create[create another user] to simulate a colleague that we might want to share our model with.

[source, python]
----
# Cypher Query
create_a_new_user_query  = """
CREATE USER testUser IF NOT EXISTS
SET PASSWORD 'test'
SET PASSWORD CHANGE NOT REQUIRED
"""

# Create driver session to the system database
with driver.session(database='system') as session:
  # Run query
  result = session.run(create_a_new_user_query).data()
  # prettify the first result
  print(json.dumps(result, indent=2, sort_keys=True))
----

== Publishing the model

To publish the model we need to use https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/model-catalog/model-catalog/#model-catalog-publish-ops[gds.alpha.model.publish] to enable other users to view the model we've created.

When we publish a model, the model's name is appended with `\_public` at the end.

[source, python]
----
# Cypher Query
publish_graph_sage_model_to_disk_query  = """
CALL gds.alpha.model.publish('example_graph_model_for_graphsage')
"""

# Create driver session to the database
with driver.session() as session:
  # Run query
  result = session.run(publish_graph_sage_model_to_disk_query).data()
  # prettify the first result
  print(json.dumps(result[0], indent=2, sort_keys=True, default=default))
----

== Viewing the model as another user

Below we'll create a new driver session using our test user credentials.

We'll then list the model catalog and see that we have access to the model that we published with our other user.

[source, python]
----
test_user_driver = GraphDatabase.driver(AURA_CONNECTION_URI, auth=("testUser", "test"))

# Create driver session to the database
with test_user_driver.session() as session:
  # Run query
  results = session.run(list_model_catalog_query).data()

  # for each result prettify the results
  for result in results:
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2, sort_keys=True, default=default) + "\n\n")
----

== Clean-up the tutorial

Run the following block of code to clean up the example data, in-memory graphs and models.

It shows how to delete nodes and relationships from the database.

How to drop our test user, in-memory graphs & models, but also how to delete the model from disk.

[source, python]
----
# Delete the example dataset from the database
delete_example_graph_query = """
MATCH (example:ExampleData)
DETACH DELETE example
"""

# Delete the in-memory graph from memory
drop_in_memory_graph_query = """
CALL gds.graph.drop("example_graph_for_graphsage")
"""


# Delete the model from disk
drop_example_models_query = """
CALL gds.beta.model.drop("example_graph_model_for_graphsage_public")
"""

# Delete the model from disk
delete_example_models_query = """
CALL gds.alpha.model.delete("example_graph_model_for_graphsage_public")
"""

# Delete the example user database
drop_example_user_query = """
DROP USER testUser
"""

# Create driver session to the database
with driver.session() as session:
  # Run queries
  print(session.run(delete_example_graph_query).data())
  print(session.run(drop_in_memory_graph_query).data())
  print(session.run(drop_example_models_query).data())
  print(session.run(delete_example_models_query).data())

with driver.session(database='system') as session:
  print(session.run(drop_example_user_query).data())

driver.close()
test_user_driver.close()
