This example shows how to:

* use the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/graph-data-science/current/common-usage/memory-estimation/[memory estimation^] mode to estimate the memory requirements for an algorithm before running it
* resize an AuraDS instance to accommodate the algorithm memory requirements

include::partial$aurads/generated-graph.adoc[]

NOTE: The graph is fairly large, so the generation procedure will take a few minutes to complete.

== Run the `estimate` mode

The estimation of the memory requirements of an algorithm on an in-memory graph can be useful to determine whether the current AuraDS instance has enough resources to run the algorithm to completion.

The Graph Data Science has guard rails built in: if an algorithm is estimated to use more RAM than is available, an exception is raised.
In this case, the AuraDS instance can be resized before running the algorithm again.

In the following example we get a memory estimation for the Label Propagation algorithm to run on the generated graph.
The estimated memory is between 381 MiB and 4477 MiB, which is higher than an 8 GB instance has available (4004 MiB).

The `mutate` procedure hits the guard rails on an 8 GB instance, raising an exception that suggests to resize the AuraDS instance.

== Resize the AuraDS instance

You will need to resize the instance to the next available size (16 GB) in order to continue.
An AuraDS instance can be resized from the https://console.neo4j.io/?product=aura-ds[Neo4j Aura Console^] homepage.
For more information, check the xref:aurads/managing-instances/instance-actions#_resizing_an_instance[Instance actions] section.

NOTE: Resizing an AuraDS instance incurs a short amount of downtime.

After resizing, wait a few seconds until the projected graph is reloaded, then run the `mutate` step again.
This time no exception is thrown and the step completes successfully.

== Cleanup

The in-memory graph can now be deleted.
