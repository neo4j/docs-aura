TIP: Follow along with a notebook in https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wCign36IRzxQacjD9vL7wkpBNjZDGace?usp=sharing[image:colab.svg[Colab,24] Google Colab^]

This brief tutorial can be followed within a Google Colab which is based on Jupyter notebooks.

Running algorithms on large graphs can be computationally expensive. As part of your workflow, you may want to chain algorithms together, inspect the progress of each step and potentially export the results to other systems or workflows.

Understanding when an algorithm has completed is especially useful in the above application.

In this tutorial, you will be shown how to use and interpret the `gds.beta.listProgress()` procedure, along with integrating it as part of your workflow.

== Checking progress Long running algorithms

We will need to start a long running algorithm that will take a little while to converge. For our example we'll try `Label Propagation` which will take some time.

In order to be able to start a long running query and inspect the progress we will use threading in this example.

# Sleep for a few seconds so the label propagation query has time to get going
print('Sleeping for 5 seconds')
time.sleep(5)

print('Sleeping for 10 more seconds')

== Clean-up the tutorial

To drop the example in-memory graph we created previously, you can use the `gds.graph.drop` procedure and specify the name of the graph we created (example-graph).
