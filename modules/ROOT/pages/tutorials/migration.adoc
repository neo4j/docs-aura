This tutorial describes how to migrate from a self-managed Neo4j database to Aura.

[CAUTION]
====
If your local Neo4j version is older than 4.3, you need to upgrade to at least Neo4j 4.3 first as explained in link:https://neo4j.com/docs/upgrade-migration-guide/current/version-4/[Upgrade and Migration Guide -> Neo4j 4 upgrades and migration].

== Preparation

=== Migrating to Neo4j 5

If you are migrating from self-managed Neo4j 4.3 or 4.4 to Neo4j 5 on Aura, carefully read the xref:tutorials/upgrade.adoc#_preparation[Preparation section in the Upgrade tutorial] to ensure you are well prepared for the migration.

=== Aura instance size

Before starting, verify that the Aura instance you are migrating to is sized accordingly.
The instance must be at least as large as your self-managed database to accommodate the data.
The Aura RAM-to-storage ratio is 1:2, which means, for example, that a 32 GB Aura instance provides 64 GB of storage.

=== APOC compatibility

If you are using any APOC procedures and functions, make sure they are all available in Aura by checking the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/platform/apoc/[APOC support page].

== Creating and uploading a database dump

In order to move data from your self-managed database to Aura, you need to create a dump of the existing database.

[NOTE]
====
This process requires a short downtime for your self-managed database.
====

The following admin commands must be invoked with the same user as your self-managed Neo4j database.
This guarantees that Neo4j has full rights to start and work with the database files you use.

. Stop your self-managed Neo4j database.
If you are running AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud or AuraDS Enterprise, you can stop only the database you want to dump using the command `STOP DATABASE {database}` in Cypher Shell or Browser.

. Ensure the target directory to store the database dumps (for instance `{dump-folder}`) exists.

. Depending on your self-managed Neo4j version, create a dump of your database (e.g., `{database}`) using one of the following options:
