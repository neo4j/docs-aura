= Migrating to Neo4j 5

Neo4j 5 introduces many new features. Existing code and data flows may therefore be affected.

== Backup and restore

TBD

== APOC

9.1. Support
Starting with Neo4j 5, a selected number of APOC methods (procedures and functions), formerly known as APOC Core, are supported by Neo4j engineering:

* Neo4j 5 APOC Library is link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/platform/apoc/[supported] in Aura with the some exceptions.
* APOC Extended library has not been included in the Neo4j 5 APOC Library and therefore is supported by the Neo4j Community exclusively.
* APOC Extended library code persists, as well as other Labs projects, in the extended repository, together with the APOC Core 4.x code.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Neo4j does not recommend or encourage the use of the APOC Extended methods in production.
====

== Indexes
BTREE indexes - use RANGE and POINT indexes instead.

== Cypher updates
