= Using the Neo4j BI Connector

In this tutorial we use the Neo4j Connector for BI to read graph data from an Aura instance using some common <<_using_command_line_sql_clients,SQL clients>> and <<_using_bi_tools,BI tools>>.

[CAUTION]
====
This tutorial includes instructions on the usage of third-party software, which may be subject to changes beyond our control. 
In case of doubt, refer to the third-party software documentation.
====

== Downloading the connector

Download the connector from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/#integrations[Download Center].
Depending on the SQL client or BI tool it will be used with, you will need either the JDBC or the ODBC connector; see the usage examples for further details.

== Preparing example data

Before trying the connector with any of the listed tools, some data needs to be loaded on Aura.
This can be achieved by running the following Cypher query in the Neo4j Browser:

[source, cypher, subs=attributes+, role=noplay]
----
CREATE
  (john:Person {name: "John", surname: "Doe", age: 42}),
  (jane:Person {name: "Jane", surname: "Doe", age: 40}),
  (john)-[:KNOWS]->(jane)
----

== Using BI tools

Commonly used BI tools include <<_tableau>> (which uses the JDBC driver) and <<_power_bi>> (which uses the ODBC driver).

[TIP]
====
When connecting with a JDBC driver, the `neo4j+s` URI scheme must be changed into `neo4j` and the `SSL=true` parameter must be added to the URL.

=== Tableau

[NOTE]
====
This example requires https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/desktop[Tableau Desktop].

Refer to the link:https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_otherdatabases_jdbc.htm[Tableau documentation] for more information on how to add a JDBC database.
====

After downloading the JDBC Neo4j Connector for BI from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/#integrations[Download Center]:

. Close any running instances of Tableau Desktop.
. Copy the Neo4j driver JAR file into the appropriate Tableau `Drivers` folder.
* Use `C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers` on Windows.
* Use `~/Library/Tableau/Drivers` on macOS.
If the folder is not visible, select `Go -> Go to Folder` in Finder to open the folder manually.

. Start Tableau and search for the `Other Databases (JDBC)` option.
. Insert the Aura URL as `jdbc:neo4j://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io?SSL=true`, leave the SQL dialect as `SQL92`, and complete the relevant credentials.

After the connection is established, you can select the `neo4j` database and the `Node` schema to find the `Person` table.
You can then explore the table to find the example data.

==== Troubleshooting

If the connection fails with a `Generic JDBC connection error`, check if you installed the Neo4j driver in the correct location and then:

* Download the `SSL.com` root certificates as explained on link:https://www.ssl.com/how-to/install-ssl-com-ca-root-certificates/[ssl.com] and install them as shown in the link:https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/jdbc_ssl_config.htm[Tableau documentation], then restart Tableau and repeat the previous steps (recommended option).
* Add `&sslTrustStrategy=TRUST_ALL_CERTIFICATES` to the connection string (after `SSL=true`) and try to connect again.
**This option requires caution and should not be used in a production environment**.

=== Power BI

[NOTE]
====
This example requires Microsoft Windows and https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/[Power BI Desktop].

Refer to the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-using-generic-interfaces[Power BI documentation] for more information on how to add an ODBC database.
====

After downloading and installing the ODBC Neo4j Connector for BI from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/#integrations[Download Center]:

. Open Power BI Desktop.
. Search for `ODBC` in the *Get data from another source* panel.
. Select `Simba Neo4j` in the *DSN dropdown* menu.
. Insert the connection string `Host=xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io;SSL=1` in the *Advanced options* section.
. Insert your username and password.

Once connected, open sequentially `ODBC` -> `neo4j` -> `Node` -> `Person` in the *Navigator* window to see a preview of the table.
