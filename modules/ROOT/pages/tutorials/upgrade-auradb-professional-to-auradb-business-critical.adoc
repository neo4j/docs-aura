This upgrade does not change the original DBID, so your application strings remain valid.
It enables the capabilities that would be otherwise available with the AuraDB Business Critical instance. 

*GDS plugin removal:* 
If your AuraDB Professional instance uses the GDS plugin, it will be removed during the upgrade. 
The GDS plugin is not supported in AuraDB Business Critical.

*Minimum instance size:* 
If you attempt to upgrade a 1GB Professional instance, you will be prompted to resize it to at least 2GB of storage, as this is the minimum supported size in AuraDB Business Critical.
