= Upgrade to Neo4j 5 within Aura
:description: This section describes how to upgrade between Neo4j Aura instances.

This tutorial describes how to upgrade to Neo4j 5 within Aura.
Be sure to follow the preparation steps beforehand.

== Preparation

=== Drivers

Neo4j's official drivers have some significant and breaking changes you need to be aware of. 
For a smooth migration:

. Check the breaking changes for each driver you use, for example in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/5.0/breaking_changes.html#breaking-changes[Python driver] and in the link:https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/changelog.md[GDS client].
. Make sure you switch to the latest version of the driver in line with the version of the Neo4j database. 
This can be done before upgrading the version of Neo4j that you are using with Aura, as 5.x drivers are backward compatible.

The link:https://neo4j.com/docs/upgrade-migration-guide/current/version-5/migration/drivers/breaking-changes/[Update and migration guide] contains all information and lists all the breaking changes.

=== Indexes

In Neo4j 5, BTREE indexes are replaced by RANGE, POINT, and TEXT indexes. 
Before migrating a database, in Neo4j 4.4, you should create a matching RANGE, POINT, or TEXT index for each BTREE index (or index-backed constraint). 
You can run `SHOW INDEXES` on your Neo4j 4.4 database to display its indexes.

In most cases, RANGE indexes can replace BTREE. 
However, there might be occasions when a different index type is more suitable, such as:

* Use POINT indexes if the property value type is `point` and `distance` or `bounding box` queries are used for the property.
* Use TEXT indexes if the property value type is `text` and the values can be larger than 8Kb.
* Use TEXT indexes if the property value type is `text` and `CONTAINS` and `ENDS WITH` are used in queries for the property.

After creating the new index, the old index should be dropped. 
The following example shows how to create a new RANGE index and drop an existing `index_name` index:

[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE RANGE INDEX range_index_name FOR (n:Label) ON (n.prop1);
DROP INDEX index_name;
----

The following example instead shows how to create a constraint backed by a RANGE index:

[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT constraint_with_provider FOR (n:Label) REQUIRE (n.prop1) IS UNIQUE OPTIONS {indexProvider: 'range-1.0'}
----

For more information about creating indexes, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes-for-search-performance/#administration-indexes-examples[Cypher Manual -> Creating indexes].

=== Cypher updates

Neo4j 5 introduces some changes to the Cypher syntax and error handling.

==== Cypher syntax

All changes in the Cypher language syntax are detailed in link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/5/deprecations-additions-removals-compatibility[Cypher Manual -> Removals, deprecations, additions and extensions].
Thoroughly review this section in the version you are moving to and make the necessary changes in your code.

Here is a short list of the main changes introduced in Neo4j 5:

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===
|*Deprecated feature*
|*Details*

|[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
MATCH (n)-[r:REL]->(m) SET n=r
----
|Use the `properties()` function instead to get the map of properties of nodes/relationships that can then be used in a `SET` clause:

[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
MATCH (n)-[r:REL]->(m) SET n=properties(r)
----

|[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
MATCH (a), (b), allShortestPaths((a)-[r]->(b)) RETURN b

MATCH (a), (b), shortestPath((a)-[r]->(b)) RETURN b
----
|`shortestPath` and `allShortestPaths` without link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/5/syntax/patterns/#cypher-pattern-varlength[variable-length relationship] are deprecated. Instead, use a `MATCH` with a `LIMIT` of 1 or:
[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
MATCH (a), (b), shortestPath((a)-[r*1..1]->(b)) RETURN b
----

|[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE DATABASE databaseName.withDot ...
----
|Creating a database with unescaped dots in the name has been deprecated, instead escape the database name:
[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE DATABASE `databaseName.withDot` ...
----
|===

==== Error/Warning/Info handling in Cypher

Many semantic errors that Cypher finds are reported as `Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError` even though they are semantic and not syntax errors.
In Neo4j 5, the metadata returned by Cypher queries is improved.

* The severity of some of the Warning codes is moved to Info:

** `SubqueryVariableShadowingWarning` -> `SubqueryVariableShadowing`
** `NoApplicableIndexWarning` -> `NoApplicableIndex`
** `CartesianProductWarning` -> `CartesianProduct`
** `DynamicPropertyWarning` -> `DynamicProperty`
** `EagerOperatorWarning` -> `EagerOperator`
** `ExhustiveShortestPathWarning` -> `ExhaustiveShortestPath`
** `UnboundedVariableLengthPatternWarning` -> `UnboundedVariableLengthPattern`
** `ExperimentalFeature` -> `RuntimeExperimental`

=== APOC

All APOC procedures and functions available in Aura are listed in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/platform/apoc/[APOC Core library].
See the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/5/[APOC documentation] for further details.

=== Procedures

Some procedures have been replaced by commands:

=== Neo4j Connectors

If you are using a Neo4j Connector for link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-spark-connector/releases/[Apache Spark] or link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-streams/releases[Apache Kafka], make sure its version is compatible with Neo4j 5.

The Neo4j BI Connectors available on the link:https://neo4j.com/download-center/#integrations[Download center] are compatible with Neo4j 5.

== Upgrading from an existing Aura instance

If you are updating an existing Aura instance, you can either:

* Clone to xref:auradb/managing-databases/database-actions.adoc#_clone_to_a_new_auradb_instance[AuraDB] or xref:aurads/managing-instances/instance-actions.adoc#_clone_to_a_new_aurads_instance[AuraDS] Neo4j 5.
* Create a new xref:auradb/getting-started/create-database.adoc[AuraDB] or xref:aurads/create-instance.adoc[AuraDS] Neo4j 5 instance and copy your data.
