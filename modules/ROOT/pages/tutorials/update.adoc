= Updating/migrating to Neo4j 5 Aura

Neo4j 5 introduces many new features. 
Existing code and data flows may therefore be affected.

== Preparing for the update/migration

The following sections apply regardless of whether you are updating your Aura instance of migrating to Aura from a self-managed instance.

=== Drivers

Neo4j's official drivers have some significant and breaking changes you need to be aware of. 
For a smooth migration:

. Check the breaking changes for each driver you use, for example in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/5.0/breaking_changes.html#breaking-changes[Python driver] and in the link:https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/changelog.md[GDS client].
. Make sure you switch to the latest version of the driver in line with the version of the Neo4j database.

The link:https://neo4j.com/docs/upgrade-migration-guide/current/version-5/migration/drivers/breaking-changes/[Update and migration guide] contains all information and lists all the breaking changes.

=== Indexes

In Neo4j 5, BTREE indexes are replaced by RANGE, POINT, and TEXT indexes. 
Before migrating a database, in Neo4j 4.4, you should create a matching RANGE, POINT, or TEXT index for each BTREE index (or index-backed constraint). 
You can run `SHOW INDEXES` on your Neo4j 4.4 database to display its indexes.

In most cases, RANGE indexes can replace BTREE. 
However, there might be occasions when a different index type is more suitable, such as:

* Use POINT indexes if the property value type is `point` and `distance` or `bounding box` queries are used for the property.
* Use TEXT indexes if the property value type is `text` and the values can be larger than 8Kb.
* Use TEXT indexes if the property value type is `text` and `CONTAINS` and `ENDS WITH` are used in queries for the property.

After creating the new index, the old index should be dropped. 
The following example shows how to create a new RANGE index and drop an existing `index_name` index:

[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE RANGE INDEX range_index_name FOR (n:Label) ON (n.prop1);
DROP INDEX index_name;
----

The following example instead shows how to create a constraint backed by a RANGE index:

[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT constraint_with_provider FOR (n:Label) REQUIRE (n.prop1) IS UNIQUE OPTIONS {indexProvider: 'range-1.0'}
----

For more information about creating indexes, see link:{cypher-manual-5-uri}/indexes-for-search-performance/#administration-indexes-examples[Cypher Manual -> Creating indexes].

=== Cypher updates

Neo4j 5 introduces some changes to the Cypher syntax and error handling.

==== Cypher syntax

A short list of the main changes introduced in Neo4j 5:

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===
|*Deprecated feature*
|*Details*

|[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
MATCH (n)-[r:REL]->(m) SET n=r
----
|Use the `properties()` function instead to get the map of properties of nodes/relationships that can then be used in a `SET` clause:

[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
MATCH (n)-[r:REL]->(m) SET n=properties(r)
----

|[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
MATCH (a), (b), allShortestPaths((a)-[r]->(b)) RETURN b

MATCH (a), (b), shortestPath((a)-[r]->(b)) RETURN b
----
|`shortestPath` and `allShortestPaths` without link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/5/syntax/patterns/#cypher-pattern-varlength[variable-length relationship] are deprecated. Instead, use a `MATCH` with a `LIMIT` of 1 or:
[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
MATCH (a), (b), shortestPath((a)-[r*1..1]->(b)) RETURN b
----

|[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE DATABASE databaseName.withDot ...
----
|Creating a database with unescaped dots in the name has been deprecated, instead escape the database name:
[source, Cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE DATABASE `databaseName.withDot` ...
----
|===

All changes in the Cypher language syntax are detailed in link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/5/deprecations-additions-removals-compatibility[Cypher Manual -> Removals, deprecations, additions and extensions].
Thoroughly review this section in the version you are moving to and make the necessary changes in your code.

==== Error/Warning/Info handling in Cypher

Many semantic errors that Cypher finds are reported as `Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError` even though they are semantic and not syntax errors.
In Neo4j v5, the metadata returned by Cypher queries is improved.

* The severity of some of the Warning codes is moved to Info:

** `SubqueryVariableShadowingWarning` -> `SubqueryVariableShadowing`
** `NoApplicableIndexWarning` -> `NoApplicableIndex`
** `CartesianProductWarning` -> `CartesianProduct`
** `DynamicPropertyWarning` -> `DynamicProperty`
** `EagerOperatorWarning` -> `EagerOperator`
** `ExhustiveShortestPathWarning` -> `ExhaustiveShortestPath`
** `UnboundedVariableLengthPatternWarning` -> `UnboundedVariableLengthPattern`
** `ExperimentalFeature` -> `RuntimeExperimental`

=== APOC

Starting with Neo4j 5, a selected number of APOC methods (procedures and functions), formerly known as APOC Core, are supported by Neo4j engineering:

* The APOC Core library is link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/platform/apoc/[supported] in Aura with some exceptions.
* The APOC Extended library is not included in Aura.

Check the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/5/[APOC documentation] for further details.

=== Procedures

Some procedures have been replaced by commands:

=== Miscellaneous

* Disallow repeated relationship variables.
* Automatic coercion of a list to a boolean.
* `exists()` function to test if property is null.
* apoc.create.uuid() and apoc.create.uuids()— deprecated and replaced by the existing UUID.randomUUID().

Refer to the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/upgrade-migration-guide/current/version-5/migration/breaking-changes/#_removals[Update and migration guide] for a full list of removals and deprecations.

== Migrate from existing Aura

If you are updating an existing Aura instance, you can either:

* xref:aurads/managing-instances/instance-actions.adoc[Clone] to Aura Neo4j 5
* xref:aurads/create-instance.adoc[Create] a new Aura Neo4j 5 instance and copy your data

== Migrating from self-managed

If you are migrating from a self-managed Neo4j 4.4 or 4.3 instance, you can use the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin/upload-to-aura/[`neo4j-admin database upload`] command to upload the database dump into a Neo4j Aura instance.

If your local Neo4j version is less than 4.3, you need to upgrade to Neo4j 4.4 first as explained in link:https://neo4j.com/docs/upgrade-migration-guide/current/version-4/[Upgrade and Migration Guide -> Neo4j 4 upgrades and migration].
