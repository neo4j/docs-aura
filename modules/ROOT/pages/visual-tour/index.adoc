= Get to know the console
:description: This section covers various aspects of using the Aura console, exploring data, managing instances, and utilizing the Explore tool for visualizing and interacting with graph data. The text provides a detailed overview of the console's structure, organization, projects, users, and data services, along with insights on instances, importing data, tools, and operations metrics. Additionally, it explains the significance of exploring data through Explore and the importance of having data in instances for effective graph database utilization.

The whole point of Aura - is using the console to then interact with your data - visualising nodes and relationships - or doing queries with cypher language. Cypher language is the future of graph database languages - it kicks SQL's ass because it can do way more advanced queries. We're not saying you have to do more advanced queries - but it really does run marvellous queries! And Cypher language is pretty neat to pick up - it's really the future of databases, and what with AI and LLMs becoming so important to the future of tech - you really need to be using a graph database because that's what the future of computing is built on.

== Projects

When you log in, you’ll find yourself in a project. The Aura console is designed for intuitive navigation, allowing you to explore using clickable cards, breadcrumbs, and dropdown menus.

== Organizations 

If you’re setting up the console, you will have access to an organization.

The organization or project you’re currently viewing will always be displayed in the header of the console as breadcrumbs.

To switch between different organisations or projects, click on the organization name in the breadcrumbs. This will open a dropdown menu where you can see all the organisations and projects you have access to, making it easy to move between them.

Once inside an organization, you’ll see a list of projects displayed as cards. These cards provide a snapshot of each project, including the number of instances and members associated with it. Clicking on a project card will take you inside that project, where you can view existing instances or create new ones as needed.

== Console UI

== Organisations, projects, instances

* Organization: The highest level, representing the overall team or company.
* Projects: Like folders, where you can keep your instances with data.
* Tenants: Homes for your data.
* Users: Individuals who interact with the organization and its projects, with varying roles and permissions.

== Data services

To get to your data, you'll need to head to a project and connect to an instance.

If your instance already contains data, you can start exploring it visually or querying it. 
If you need to import data, go to Explore and follow the instructions to bring in a dataset, such as Northwind. 
Exploring data is central to using Aura, so you'll always need to go to Explore for this purpose—unless you're an admin or operations person who only needs to manage the system without diving into the data itself.

== Instances 

Think of your instance as a database that is running in the Aura cloud. 
The cloud is a way to store and access data and applications over the internet instead of on your own computer or local storage. 
Think of it like using a remote hard drive that's always available online. 
You can save files, run programs, and access information from anywhere with an internet connection, and you don’t need to worry about the physical hardware or storage space on your own device.

Expand an instance card to see what you can do, such as viewing metrics, taking snapshots, or pausing the instance—none of which require data.

To see the power of a graph database, you'll need some data in your instance. 
You can follow the *workspace guide* to get that set up. 
*Once you're connected, you're ready to go!*

If you already have an instance with data in it, there's no need to start from scratch; you can jump right in and start working with your existing data.

== Import

You'll want to get some data into your instance, so you can *start to explore it visually and query it with Cypher.*

Import data from local files. 
We have a whole section on that. link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/data-import/csv-import/[csv import]
If you're new to Aura, we recommend following the workspace guide.

== Tools

The left side panel is where you access all your tools. 
Once you’ve connected to an instance, you can switch between Explore and Query to use the graph tools or connect to different instances.

=== Explore

link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/current/bloom-quick-start/[bloom]

See the patterns you intuitively know are there in your data, and reveals new patterns you may not have expected. This new data vision opens up new ways of thinking, new ways of working and new possibilities. And it’s fun.

Explore helps you visualize and interact with your graph data. Here’s a simple breakdown:

* Visual Exploration: It lets you see your data as a graph, with nodes (data points) and relationships between them. This visual representation makes it easier to understand and analyze complex data connections.

* Interactive Queries: You can run Cypher queries to explore and manipulate the graph. The tool updates the visual graph based on the results of your queries.

* Data Insights: By interacting with the graph, you can uncover patterns, trends, and insights that are not easily visible in traditional tabular data formats like SQL.

Overall, Explore is designed to make working with graph data more intuitive and insightful by providing a visual and interactive way to analyze and manage your data.

In Explore, you can delve into specific data sets and perform interesting queries using Cypher.

=== Query

You will definitely want to get accustomed to Cypher language!
link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/cypher-intro/-[Cypher]

This section introduces you to the graph query language — Cypher®. It aims to help you start thinking about graphs and patterns, apply this knowledge to simple problems, and learn how to write Cypher statements.

When you run queries on your data, you'll be able to see your nodes and relationships

I just want a simple dataset I can use!

== Operations

Metrics refer to the various measurements and statistics that help you monitor and analyze the performance and usage of your database. Here’s a breakdown of the metrics available on an instance card:

* CPU usage: CPU is used for planning and serving queries. If this metric is constantly spiking, consider increasing the size of your instance if you find this chart is at its limits.
* Storage: As your graph grows, it will use storage space on disk. Keep an eye on this metric to make sure you have enough storage for today and for future growth. If you are approaching the limits, resize your instance to accommodate your intended growth rate.
* Query exectutions: A query execution is the process of running a database query to retrieve, modify, or manage data. In essence, query execution is what happens when you ask the database a question or give it a command, and it works to provide the answer or make the requested changes. Here’s a simple explanation:
** Query: A request made to the database using a specific language (like Cypher) to perform tasks such as fetching data, updating records, or analyzing information.
** Execution: The actual process of the database handling and processing this request. It involves interpreting the query, running it against the stored data, and returning the results.

== Logs

Track and review system activities and events. Logs provide insights into database operations, errors, and other critical events, helping you monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

== Project

Represents a specific area within your console where you can manage and organize your data and resources. Each project operates independently, allowing you to segment and focus on different tasks or datasets.

=== Users

Individuals who have access to your project to do admin work, or to the instances to do datawork. You can manage user accounts, assign permissions, and control access levels to ensure secure and appropriate use of the database.

=== Roles

Define the permissions and responsibilities of users within your console. Roles help manage what actions users can perform and what data they can access, ensuring proper access control and organization.

=== Billing

Manage your subscription and payment details. This section provides information on usage costs, billing history, and payment options, helping you keep track of expenses and manage your budget.

=== Settings

Configuration options for customizing and optimizing your console. This includes adjusting performance settings, configuring alerts, and managing other system preferences to suit your needs.
