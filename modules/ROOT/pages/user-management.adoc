:description: This page describes how to manage users in Neo4j Aura.
:page-aliases: platform/user-management.adoc

User management is a feature within Aura that allows admins to invite users and set their roles within an isolated environment.

You can view and manage roles from *Users* pages, accessible via the console sidebar.
An organization has one *Users* page for managing organization-level roles.
Each project has a *Users* page for managing project-specific roles.

[NOTE]
====
Users can only be invited on the project-level.
Regardless of which project-role is specified in the invitation, the user is added to the organization as an `ORG_MEMBER` by default.
The organization-level role cannot be changed until the user accepts their invitation.
====

== Organization-level roles

Roles at the organization level determine what administrative capabilities a user has across all projects within the organization.

The following roles are available at the org level:

* `ORG_OWNER`
* `ORG_ADMIN`
* `ORG_MEMBER`

[[roles]]
== Project-level roles

Users within a project can be assigned one of the following roles:

* `PROJECT_VIEWER`
* `METRICS READER`
* `PROJECT_MEMBER`
* `PROJECT_ADMIN`

[NOTE]
====
Each project must have at least one Project Admin, but it is also possible for projects to have multiple Project Admins.
====

=== Metrics reader role

The `METRICS_READER` role can be assigned to any user or service account.
It has the same permissions as the `PROJECT_VIEWER` role, but with some extra permissions specifically for reading metrics via an API endpoint.
The role allows access to metrics for all instances in a project.
Accessing metric endpoints requires xref:/api/authentication.adoc[Aura API Credentials] and the `METRICS_READER` role enables the creation of these credentials.

The `METRICS_READER` role can view and open instances in the console, however, login to the instance is required to interact with it, with access to Explore and Query defined by the instanceâ€™s RBAC settings.

=== Predefined roles

Users within a project can access instances seamlessly with their console role if xref:security/tool-auth.adoc[Tool authentication with Aura user] is enabled.

[NOTE]
====
New organizations created after June 3rd 2025 will have Tool authentication with Aura user enabled by default.
====

When enabled, a user connects seamlessly with a predefined database role that matches their console role, i.e. their project-level role.
Predefined roles are *immutable* and apply to all Free, Professional, and Business Critical instances.
The predefined roles are assigned the following privileges on the instance level:

The predefined roles take the following format: `console_<role>_<dbid>`, for example `console_member_73b84556` or `console_admin_pro_73b84556`.

[TIP]
====
User management within the Aura console does not replace built-in roles or fine-grained RBAC at the database level.
====

=== Invite users

* As an _Admin_, go to *Users* from within a project, and select *Invite users*.
You need to provide an email address for the new user and decide which project-level role to assign them.
* The invited user will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation and their status is *Pending* until they accept the invitation.
Note that on accepting the invite, the invited user automatically gets an `ORG_MEMBER` role in the organization the project is part of.
If needed, you can edit the organization-level role after the invite is accepted.

=== Edit users and roles

From the *Users* page, as and _Admin_, you can delete users or edit their roles using the [...] more menu by the user's name.
