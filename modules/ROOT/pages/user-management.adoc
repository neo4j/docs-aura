The users with access to a project can be viewed and managed from the *Users* page.
Access the Users page by selecting Users from the sidebar menu of the console.

The project you're currently viewing is displayed in the header of the console.
You can select the project name to open the project dropdown menu, allowing you to view all the projects that you have access to and switch between them.

Additionally, you can perform the following actions from the *Project Settings* page.
You can access the **Settings** page by selecting **Settings** from the sidebar menu of the console.

* Edit the name of the project you are currently viewing by selecting the pencil icon next to the project name. This action requires you to be an Admin of the project.

=== Roles

Users within a project can be assigned one of the following roles:

* _Project Viewer_
* _Metrics Reader_
* _Project Member_
* _Project Admin_

==== Metrics reader role

The `metrics reader` role can be assigned to any user or service account.
It has the same permissions as the `project viewer` role, but with some extra permissions specifically for reading metrics via an API endpoint.
The role allows access to metrics for all instances in a project.
Accessing metric endpoints requires xref:/api/authentication.adoc[Aura API Credentials] and the `metrics reader` role enables the creation of these credentials.

The `metrics reader` role can view and open instances in the console, however, login to the instance is required to interact with it, with access to Explore and Query defined by the instanceâ€™s RBAC settings.

[NOTE]
====
Each project must have at least one Project Admin, but it is also possible for projects to have multiple Project Admins.

=== Predefined roles

Users within a project can access instances seamlessly with their console role if xref:security/tool-auth.adoc[Tool authentication with Aura user] is enabled.

[NOTE]
====
New organizations created after May 5th 2025 will have Tool auhtentication with Aura user enabled by default.
====

When enabled, a user connects seamlessly with a predefined database role that matches their console role, i.e. their project-level role.
Predefined roles are *immutable* and apply to all Free, Professional, and Business Critical instances.
The predefined roles are assigned the following privileges on the instance level:

// ====

=== Accepting an invite

When invited to a project, you will receive an email with a link to accept the invite.
This link will direct you to the Aura console, where a **Project invitation** modal will appear.
You can select the project(s) you have been invited to and choose to accept or decline the invite(s).

// You can also close the **Project invitation** modal without accepting or declining the invite(s) and later manually re-open the modal by selecting the **Pending invites** envelope icon in the console header.

// [TIP]
// ====
// User management within the Aura console does not replace built-in roles or fine-grained RBAC at the database level.
// ====
