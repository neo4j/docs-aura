// ====

=== Accepting an invite

When invited to a project, you will receive an email with a link to accept the invite.
This link will direct you to the Aura console, where a **Project invitation** modal will appear.
You can select the project(s) you have been invited to and choose to accept or decline the invite(s).

// You can also close the **Project invitation** modal without accepting or declining the invite(s) and later manually re-open the modal by selecting the **Pending invites** envelope icon in the console header.

[TIP]
====
User management within the Aura console does not replace built-in roles or fine-grained RBAC at the database level.
====

== Metrics reader role

The `metrics reader` role can be assigned to any user,
It has the same permissions as the `project viewer` role, but with some extra permissions specifically for reading metrics via an API endpoint. 
The role allows them to read metrics for all instances within a project.
Accessing metric endpoints requires xref:/api/authentication.adoc[Aura API Credentials] and a the `metrics reader` role enables the user to create these credentials.

Users with the `metrics reader` role can view and open instances (without access to any tools unless they login) in the console. 
However, they must still log in to the instance to be able to interact with it further, and access to the Explore and Query tools are defined by the instanceâ€™s RBAC settings.
