Neo4j offers cloud services through two billing models. Prepaid consumption plans, where credits are deducted from the available balance each month. 
Or pay-as-you-go, where usage is invoiced and charged on your credit card monthly in arrears.

At the top-right corner of the Billing page, there's a summary of the total amount due for the current month.
This value is shown in Aura Credits (ACU), providing a real-time estimate of your projected billing.

== Required roles

The report is available to the following roles: `Organization Owner`, `Organization Admin`, and `Project Admin`.

To view the report, a payment method must be attached to the account.
If there's no billing method attached, in a project, on the *Billing* page there's a button to *Add new payment information*.

== Consumption report

The consumption report gives real-time insights into resource usage for the current project, including both running and paused states.
You can also Export a CSV file containing usage in a selected period.

=== Filters

* Filter the usage data by predefined and custom date intervals.
* Look back for a period of up to one year.
* Filter by `Last 24 hours`, `Last 7 days`, `Last 30 days`, `Last 90 days` or a `Custom range`.

=== Instances and Sessions

There are two tabs for reviewing consumption by type:

* The *Instances* tab includes a billing summary for database instances. 
* The *Sessions* tab includes a billing summary for any Graph Analytics sessions

=== Product name and pricing

For more information, refer to link:https://console-preview.neo4j.io/pricing[Aura Pricing] for the specific product names and their prices. 
If a database is paused, its charge is reduced to 20% of the standard hourly rate.

=== Billing status

Can be `ongoing` (currently being billed) or `ended` (historical usage).

=== Units of measure

Usage is displayed in the specified unit of measure.
GB-hours usage is calculated by multiplying the number of hours a database is running (whether actively used or not) by the memory size in gigabytes (GB).
