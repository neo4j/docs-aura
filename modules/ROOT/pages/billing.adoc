:description: Consumption reporting allows Virtual Dedicated Cloud customers to closely monitor their consumption.

label:AuraDB-Virtual-Dedicated-Cloud[]

Virtual Dedicated Cloud services are offered through prepaid consumption plans.
Billing is based on usage, with credits deducted from the available balance each month.

The consumption report, accessible in the Aura console’s Billing section, provides real-time insights into resource usage for the current project, including both running and paused states.
It displays RAM usage in GB-hours and the equivalent cost in prepaid credits.
You can also Export a CSV containing usage in a selected period.

Available to Admins, the report helps track usage patterns over time to make informed resource allocation decisions.

== Consumption report

Monitor consumption in real-time in the Aura console’s Billing section.

=== Product name and pricing

For more information, refer to https://console-preview.neo4j.io/pricing[Aura Pricing] for the specific product names and their prices. If a database is paused, its charge is reduced to 20% of the standard hourly rate.

=== Billing status

Can be `ongoing` (currently being billed) or `ended` (historical usage).

=== Units of measure

Units of measure are displayed in the specified unit of measure, often GB-hours.
GB-hours usage is calculated by multiplying the number of hours a database is running (whether actively used or not) by the memory size in gigabytes (GB).

== Filters

* Filter the usage data by predefined and custom date intervals.
* Look back for a period of up to one year.
* Filter by `Last 24 hours`, `Last 7 days`, `Last 30 days`, `Last 90 days` or a `Custom range`.
