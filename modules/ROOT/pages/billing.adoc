Billing is based on usage, with credits deducted from the available balance each month.

If a database is paused, its charge is reduced to 20% of the standard hourly rate.

=== Billing status

Can be `ongoing` (currently being billed) or `ended` (historical usage).

=== Units of measure

Units of measure are displayed in the specified unit of measure applicable to the account.

Note that GB-hours usage is calculated by multiplying the number of hours a database is running (whether actively used or not) by the memory size in gigabytes (GB).

== Filters

* Filter the usage data by predefined and custom date intervals.
* Look back for a period of up to one year.
* Filter by `Last 24 hours`, `Last 7 days`, `Last 30 days`, `Last 90 days` or a `Custom range`.
