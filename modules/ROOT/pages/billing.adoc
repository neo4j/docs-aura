Neo4j offers cloud services through prepaid consumption plans or through pay-as-you-go plans. 
Billing is based on usage.

For prepaid consumption, credits are deducted from the available balance each month. 
For pay-as-you-go, usage is invoiced and charged on your credit card monthly in arrears.

At the top-right corner of the Billing page, there's a summary of the total amount due for the current month.
This value is shown in Aura Credits (ACU), providing a real-time estimate of your projected billing.


== Add new payment information

If there's no billing method attached, in a project, when *Billing* is selected, there is a call to action to *Add new payment information*.


== Consumption report

The consumption report, accessible in the Billing section, provides real-time insights into resource usage for the current project, including both running and paused states.
It displays RAM usage in GB-hours and the equivalent cost in prepaid credits.
You can also Export a CSV file containing usage in a selected period.

The report is available to the following roles: `Organization Owner`, `Organization Admin`, and `Project Admin`.
To view the billing consumption report, a payment method must be attached to the account.

=== Instances and Sessions

There are two tabs for reviewing consumption by type:

* The *Instances* tab includes a billing summary for database instances. 
* The *Sessions* tab includes a billing summary for any Graph Analytics sessions

=== Product name and pricing

For more information, refer to link:https://console-preview.neo4j.io/pricing[Aura Pricing] for the specific product names and their prices. 
If a database is paused, its charge is reduced to 20% of the standard hourly rate.

=== Billing status

Can be `ongoing` (currently being billed) or `ended` (historical usage).

=== Units of measure

Usage is displayed in the specified unit of measure.
GB-hours usage is calculated by multiplying the number of hours a database is running (whether actively used or not) by the memory size in gigabytes (GB).

=== Filters

* Filter the usage data by predefined and custom date intervals.
* Look back for a period of up to one year.
* Filter by `Last 24 hours`, `Last 7 days`, `Last 30 days`, `Last 90 days` or a `Custom range`.
