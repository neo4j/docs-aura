Virtual Dedicated Cloud services are offered through prepaid consumption plans.
Billing is based on usage, with credits deducted from the available balance each month.

== Consumption report

The consumption report, accessible in the Aura consoleâ€™s Billing section, provides real-time insights into resource usage for the current project, including both running and paused states.
It displays RAM usage in GB-hours and the equivalent cost in prepaid credits.
You can also Export a CSV containing usage in a selected period.

Available to Admins, the consumption report helps track usage patterns over time to make informed resource allocation decisions.
The usage data is also exportable.

=== Product name and pricing

For more information, refer to https://console-preview.neo4j.io/pricing[Aura Pricing] for the specific product names and their prices. 
If a database is paused, its charge is reduced to 20% of the standard hourly rate.

=== Billing status

Can be `ongoing` (currently being billed) or `ended` (historical usage).

=== Units of measure

Units of measure are displayed in the specified unit of measure, often GB-hours.
GB-hours usage is calculated by multiplying the number of hours a database is running (whether actively used or not) by the memory size in gigabytes (GB).

== Filters

* Filter the usage data by predefined and custom date intervals.
* Look back for a period of up to one year.
* Filter by `Last 24 hours`, `Last 7 days`, `Last 30 days`, `Last 90 days` or a `Custom range`.
