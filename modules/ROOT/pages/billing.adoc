Virtual Dedicated Cloud services are offered through prepaid consumption plans.
Billing is based on usage, with credits deducted from the available balance each month.
The report helps track usage patterns over time to make informed resource allocation decisions.
The usage data is also exportable.

== Required roles

Available to roles `Organzation Owner`, `Organization Admin` and `Project Admin`.
To view the billing consumption report, a payment method must be attached to the account. 

== Add new payment information

If there's no billing method attached, in a project, when they select *Billing* they see a call to action to *Add new payment information*. 

== Monthly summary

At the top-right corner of the Billing page, there's a summary of the total amount due for the current month. 
This value is shown in Aura Credits (ACU), providing a real-time estimate of your projected billing.

== Consumption report

The consumption report, accessible in the Billing section, provides real-time insights into resource usage for the current project, including both running and paused states.
It displays RAM usage in GB-hours and the equivalent cost in prepaid credits.
You can also Export a CSV file containing usage in a selected period.

== Tabs: Instances and Sessions

There's two tabs for reviewing consumption by type:

* The *Instances* tab includes a billing summary for database instances. 
* The *Sessions* tab includes a billing summary for any Graph Analytics sessions

=== Product name and pricing

For more information, refer to link:https://console-preview.neo4j.io/pricing[Aura Pricing] for the specific product names and their prices. 
If a database is paused, its charge is reduced to 20% of the standard hourly rate.

=== Billing status

Can be `ongoing` (currently being billed) or `ended` (historical usage).

=== Units of measure

Units of measure are displayed in the specified unit of measure applicable to the account.
Note that GB-hours usage is calculated by multiplying the number of hours a database is running (whether actively used or not) by the memory size in gigabytes (GB).

== Filters

* Filter the usage data by predefined and custom date intervals.
* Look back for a period of up to one year.
* Filter by `Last 24 hours`, `Last 7 days`, `Last 30 days`, `Last 90 days` or a `Custom range`.
