= Creating a dashboard with AI

. In the **Create with AI** dialog, you can enter an optional natural language text prompt to let Neo4j create a customized dashboard.
. Once you are happy with the prompt, **Create** the dashboard.

[NOTE]
====
When creating a dashboard with AI, the AI analyzes your database schema, not the actual data in your database.
====

If you do not enter a prompt, Neo4j AI will still make use of your database schema and come up with a suitable dashboard.

Note that the following examples might differ when you reproduce them.
This is due to the nature of how LLM processing works.
