= Import
:description: This page holds information about import options for dashboards.

When you create a dashboard, you can choose to **Import**.

In the **Import dashboard** dialog, you have several options to source the dashboard specification for the import:

* Browse for a JSON file on your machine.
* Select a dashboard specification that is stored in your database.
* Drag and drop or paste a dashboard specification in JSON format to the editor.

Note that you only have the option to select a stored dashboard specification when there are stored dashboards in your database.

It is not possible to delete stored dashboards from the database through the dashboard application.

If the dashboard specification selected for the import is syntactically correct, the **Import dashboard** dialog displays a **Summary** and **Details** for the import.
This means that the import can be run.

== Summary

Data fields relevant to the import are displayed under **Summary**.

The latest version of both NeoDash Labs and NeoDash commercial are supported.
However, the import procedure can always attempt to import a dashboard specification, even if the version differs from those.

The summary includes the number of imported pages, cards, parameters and filters.
You can see how many cards and filters were migrated, converted or skipped.

Cards and filters tagged as migrated have a type that is supported by Aura dashboards and they can be fully migrated.
If they are converted, Aura dashboards converts them to the closest supported similar type available, for example a NeoDash commercial map report is converted to an Aura dashboard graph visualization.
The import procedure skips any types it can neither migrate nor convert.

Note that not all settings from NeoDash reports have a counterpart in Aura dashboards.
Any such settings do not affect the import and are not preserved by the import procedure.


== Details

Expand the **Details** to inspect incidents reported during the import.

Entries include the location of the incident in the JSON specification, that is, the specific page and report, as well as a description what went wrong or is of note.


== Example

Here is an example NeoDash dashboard specification:

Upon import, the following **Summary** and **Details** are generated:

.Example import
image::dashboards/import/import-example.png[]

The import procedure was only able to import two of the four filters in the dashboard specification.
The details hint at the reason: the second and third report (index 1 and 2) have an unsupported parameter select type (`Free Text` and `Date Picker`).
The third **Details** entry reveals that the fourth report is missing an entity type, a property type and a parameter name.
However, the import can still successfully create a parameter for this parameter select report, while it cannot for the other two.
