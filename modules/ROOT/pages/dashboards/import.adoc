= Import
:description: This page holds information about import options for dashboards.

When you create a dashboard, you can choose to **Import**.

In the **Import dashboard** dialog, you have several options to source the dashboard specification for the import:

* Browse for a JSON file on your machine.
* Select a dashboard specification that is stored in your database.
* Drag and drop or paste a dashboard specification in JSON format to the editor.

[NOTE]
====
Note that you only have the option to select a stored dashboard specification when there are stored dashboards in your database.

It is not possible to delete stored dashboards from the database through the dashboard application.
====

If the dashboard specification selected for the import is syntactically correct, the **Import dashboard** dialog displays a **Summary** and **Details** for the import.
This means that the import can be run.

== Summary

Data fields relevant to the import are displayed under **Summary**.

The latest version of both NeoDash Labs and NeoDash commercial are supported.
However, the import procedure can always attempt to import a dashboard specification, even if the version differs from those.

The summary includes:

* the number of imported pages, cards, parameters and filters.
* the number of cards and filters that were _migrated_, _converted_ or _skipped_.
** _Migrated_ cards and filters have a type that is supported by Aura dashboards.
** _Converted_ cards and filters have a closest supported similar type available in Aura dashboards.
  For example a NeoDash commercial map report is converted to an Aura dashboard graph visualization.
** The import procedure _skips_ any types it can neither migrate nor convert.

Note that not all settings from NeoDash reports have a counterpart in Aura dashboards.
Any such settings do not affect the import and are not preserved by the import procedure.


== Details

Expand the **Details** to inspect incidents reported during the import.

Entries include the location of the incident in the JSON specification, that is, the specific page and report, as well as a description what went wrong or is of note.

Descriptions can be, for example:

* Unsupported parameter select types, resulting in skipped filters.
* Missing entity and/or property types, missing parameter names.
