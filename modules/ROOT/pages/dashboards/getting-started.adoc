You need:

. A Neo4j Aura account
. A Neo4j Aura database instance

See the Aura xref::/getting-started/quick-start-guide.adoc[Quick start guide] for details.

== Add a sample data set

Import the Northwind dataset to your instance:

* In Aura, click **Learn** at the top right.
* In the **Beginner** page, click the **Learn the basics** guide.
* When prompted to **Connect to instance**, select the instance where you would like to import sample data.
* In step 4 of 11 of the guide, click **Get the Northwind dataset**.
* In the **Import** page, click **Run import**.

The examples on this page refer to dataset.


== Create a dashboard

Create a new dashboard:

. In the **Dashboards** page, click **Create dashboard** at the top right.
. In the **New dashboard** dialog, assign a title and an optional description to your dashboard and click **Create**.
. Click the dashboard tile.
. Your dashboard has a single page.
// add a step as soon as page titles can be edited.
. Click **Add card** to create cards which represent visualizations.
