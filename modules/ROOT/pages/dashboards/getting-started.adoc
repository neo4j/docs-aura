:description: Follow these steps for a working example of Neo4j dashboards.

Set up a working example of Neo4j dashboards.

== Prerequisites

You need:

. A Neo4j Aura account
. A Neo4j Aura database instance

See xref::/getting-started/create-account.adoc[Create an account] and xref::/getting-started/create-instance.adoc[Create an instance] for details.

== Add a sample data set

Import the Northwind dataset to your instance:

* In Aura, find the **Learn** button at the top right.
* In the **Beginner** page, select the **Learn the basics** guide.
* When prompted to **Connect to instance**, select the instance where you would like to import sample data.
* In step 4 of 11 of the guide, import via **Get the Northwind dataset**.
* Run the import from the **Import** page via **Run import**.

The examples on this page refer to the Northwind dataset.


== Create a dashboard

Create a new dashboard:

. In the **Dashboards** page, create a new dashboard with **Create dashboard** at the top right.
. If prompted to **Connect to instance**, select your instance.
. The UI takes you directly to the new dashboard. To change the title, select the title text and edit it, then confirm.
. Your dashboard has a single page titled "Main page". To change the name, hover it and then use the three dots icon and **Edit page name**.
. Use **Add card** to create cards which represent visualizations.


=== Add a card with a bar chart

Create a bar chart which displays the number of orders per customer.

In the dashboard page tab:

. Use **Add card** at the bottom right of the page.
. Optionally change the title of the card by clicking and editing, then confirm.
. In the new card, use the three dots icon at the top right, then select **Bar chart** as the **Chart type**.
. **Edit** the Cypher query of the card and paste the following Cypher query to the input field, then **Save**:
+
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PURCHASED]->(o:Order)
RETURN c.contactName AS Customer, count(o) AS Orders
ORDER BY Orders DESC LIMIT 10
----

Your bar chart should look like this:

=== Add a card with a line chart

Create a line chart which displays the number of products for each order ID.

In the dashboard page tab:

. Use **Add card** at the bottom right of the page.
. Optionally change the title of the card by clicking and editing, then confirm.
. In the new card, use the three dots icon at the top right, then select **Line chart** as the **Chart type**.
. **Edit** the Cypher query of the card and paste the following Cypher query to the input field, then **Save**:
+
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Order)-[:ORDERS]->(p:Product)
RETURN datetime(replace(o.orderDate, " ", "T")) AS Date,
       count(p) as Categories
LIMIT 20
----

Your line chart should look like this:
