= Bar chart
:description: The Neo4j dashboard bar chart visualization.

A bar chart displays different categories and values in a bar layout.
Choose the following:

* *Category*: a text field. Categories are the bar labels.
* *Value*: a numeric field. This determines the height of the bars.

//* *Group*: A second optional text field. When grouping is enabled in the advanced settings, the group can be used to draw a stacked bar chart, with several groups per category.
