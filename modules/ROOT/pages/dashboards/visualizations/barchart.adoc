= Bar chart
:description: The Neo4j Aura dashboard bar chart.

A bar chart displays different categories and values in a bar layout.
Choose the following:

* *Category*: a text field. Categories are the bar labels.
* *Value*: a numeric field. This determines the height of the bars.

//* *Group*: A second optional text field. When grouping is enabled in the advanced settings, the group can be used to draw a stacked bar chart, with several groups per category.


== Examples


=== Simple bar chart

A Cypher query for a bar chart which displays the number of people who acted in, directed or rated movies by title:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[e]->(m:Movie)
RETURN m.title as Title, COUNT(p) as People ORDER BY People DESC LIMIT 20
----
