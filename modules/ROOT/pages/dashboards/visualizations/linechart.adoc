= Line chart
:description: The Neo4j Aura dashboard line chart.

You can use a line chart to draw one or more lines in a two-dimensional plane.
It has two numeric fields:

* *Value*: The values used on the x-axis.
* *Dimension*: The values used as the y-axis.

// Needs confirmation:
// The line chart supports plotting both simple numbers and time values on the x-axis.
// If you select a Neo4j datetime property on the x-axis, the chart is automatically drawn as a time series.


== Examples


=== Basic line chart

Cypher query for a line chart which displays the number of products per order ID:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Order)-[:ORDERS]->(p:Product)
RETURN o.orderID AS OrderID, count(p) as Products
----

=== Multi-line chart

////
Cypher query for a line chart which displays the number of actors born and number of movies released by decade:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)
WITH (date(a.born).year / 10) * 10 AS Decade, count(a) AS Actors ORDER BY Decade ASC
MATCH (m:Movie) 
WHERE (date(m.released).year / 10) * 10 = Decade 
RETURN Decade, Actors, count(DISTINCT m) AS Movies
----

|Name |Type |Default value |Description

|Plot Type |List |line | Whether to use a line plot (with connections) or a scatter plot of disjointed points.

|Show Legend |on/off |off |If set, shows a legend at the top right of the visualization.

|Color Scheme |List |neodash |The color scheme to use for the lines.
Colors are assigned automatically to the different fields selected in the report footer.

|X Scale |List |Linear |How to scale the values on the x-axis.
Can be either linear, logarithmic or point. Use point for categorical data.

|Y Scale |List |Linear |How to scale the values on the y-axis. Can be
either linear or logarithmic.

|Min x Value |Number |Auto |If not set to "auto", this variable is the minimum value on the x-axis.

|Max x Value |Number |Auto |If not set to "auto", this variable is the maximum value on the x-axis.

|Min y Value |Number |Auto |If not set to "auto", this variable is the minimum value on the y-axis.

|Max y Value |Number |Auto |If not set to "auto", this variable is the maximum value on the y-axis.

|X-axis Tick Count |Number |Auto |If not set to "auto", the number of ticks to be made on the x-axis. This is an approximate number that the visualization tries to adhere to (numeric X-axis only).

|X-axis Format (Time chart) |Text |%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ |When using a time chart, this setting lets you override how time values are rendered on the x-axis. This uses the ISO 8601 time notations.

|X-axis Tick Size (Time chart) |Text |every 1 year |When using a time chart, this setting helps you set the frequency of ticks. The text format should look like this:
`"every [number] ['years', 'months', 'weeks', 'days', 'hours', 'seconds', 'milliseconds']"`.

|Line Smoothing |List |Linear |Determines how the lines in the chart are smoothened.
One of linear (no smoothing), basis (interpolating), cardinal (through each point) and step (step-based interpolation).

|X-axis Tick Rotation (Degrees) |Number |0 | The angle at which the tick labels on the x-axis are rotated.

|Y-axis Tick Rotation (Degrees) |Number |0 | The angle at which the tick labels on the y-axis are rotated.

|Show Grid |on/off |on |If enabled, shows a grid in the line chart that
intersects at the axis ticks.

|Point Radius (px) |Number |10 |The size of a point on each line.

|Line Width (px) |Number |2 |The width (in pixels) of each line in the chart.

|Margin Left (px) |Number |50 |The margin in pixels on the left side of
the visualization.

|Margin Right (px) |Number |24 |The margin in pixels on the right side of the visualization.

|Margin Top (px) |Number |24 |The margin in pixels on the top side of the visualization.

|Margin Bottom (px) |Number |40 |The margin in pixels on the bottom side of the visualization.

|Legend Width (px) |Number |128 |The width in pixels of each legend label on top of the visualization (if enabled).

|Hide Property Selection |on/off |off |If set, hides the property selector (footer of the visualization).

|Auto-run query |on/off |on |If set, automatically runs the query when the report is displayed.
Otherwise, the query is displayed and must be executed manually.

|Report Description |Markdown text | | If set, adds a button to the report header that opens a pop-up.
The pop-up contains the rendered Markdown from this setting.
