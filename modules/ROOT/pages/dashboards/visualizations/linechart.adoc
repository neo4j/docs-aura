= Line chart
:description: The Neo4j dashboard line chart visualization.

You can use a line chart to draw one or more lines in a two-dimensional plane.
It has two numeric fields:

* **Dimension**: The values used as the x-axis.
* **Value**: The values used on the y-axis.

// Needs confirmation:
// The line chart supports plotting both simple numbers and time values on the x-axis.
// If you select a Neo4j datetime property on the x-axis, the chart is automatically drawn as a time series.

[TIP]
====
Select a horizontal segment of the line chart to zoom in.
Use the reload button to reset the line chart zoom.
