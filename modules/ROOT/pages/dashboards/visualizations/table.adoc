:description: The Neo4j dashboard table visualization.


Neo4j dashboard tables can render all data returned by a Cypher query as a result table.

Results are paginated and you can select the number of results per page. 
Sort by a result column by clicking the column header. 

When you hover over a table cell, a copy icon appears towards the end of the cell which lets you copy the content of the table cell to the clipboard.


== Example

//=== Basic table

.Cypher query for a table which displays the number of products per category
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Product)-[:PART_OF]->(c:Category)
RETURN c.categoryName AS Category, count(p) AS Products LIMIT 20
----

== Configuration

You can toggle rich rendering of cells, which adds syntax highlight and makes the result data types clear.
