:description: The Neo4j Aura dashboard table.


// Needs verification:
Neo4j Aura dashboard tables can render all data returned by a Cypher query.
This includes simple data like numbers or text, but also Neo4j native data like nodes, relationships, and paths.

////
Tables support the following additional features: 

- Automatic pagination of results. 
- Sorting/filtering by clicking on the table headers. 
- Prefixing a column header with `__` (double underscore) will make the column hidden.
- Downloading your data as a CSV file.
////

When you hover over a table cell, a copy icon appears towards the end of the cell.
Click it to copy the content of the table cell to the clipboard.

== Examples

=== Basic table

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
RETURN n.title AS Title, n.released AS Released, count(p) as Actors LIMIT 20
----

== Advanced settings

Lorem ipsum.

////
[width="100%",cols="12%s,6%,26%,56%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Type |Default value |Description

|Transpose rows and columns |on/off |off |If set, transposes the rows and columns of the table. This means that each of the returned rows from Neo4j is shown as a column instead of a row.

|Compact table |on/off |off |If set, makes the rows half their normal height and increases the number of rows per page accordingly.

|Relative column sizes |List of numbers |[1, 1, 1, â€¦] |The relative width between each of the columns in the table. For example, if the first column should be twice the width of the 2nd and 3rd, set this to ``[2, 1, 1]''.

|Enable CSV download |on/off |off |If set, displays a button on the bottom right of the table footer. This button lets a user download the complete set of table results (all pages) as a CSV file.

|Override no data message |Text |'Query returned no data.' |Override the message displayed to the user when their query returns no data.

|Auto-run query |on/off |on |If set, automatically runs the query when the report is displayed.
Otherwise, the query is displayed and must be executed manually.

|Report Description |Markdown text | | If set, adds a button to the report header that opens a pop-up.
The pop-up contains the rendered Markdown from this setting.

== Rule-based styling

Lorem ipsum.

////
Using the xref::/user-guide/extensions/rule-based-styling.adoc[] menu, the following style rules can be applied to the table: 

- The background color of an entire row in a table. 
- The text color of an entire row in a table. 
- The background color of a single cell in the table. 
- The text color of a single cell in the table.

If a column is hidden (header prefixed with `__` double underscore), it can still be used as an entry point for a styling rule.
////


== Report actions

Lorem ipsum.

////
With the xref:/user-guide/extensions/report-actions.adoc[] extension, tables can be turned into interactive components that set parameters.
Two flavours of report actions for tables exist, see the following sections.
////

=== Select a value from a row

Lorem ipsum.

////
Adding a "cell clicked" action to a table column turns the values in that row into clickable buttons.
When the user clicks on the button, a predefined parameter is set to one of the columns in that row.

////


=== Select multiple from a row

Lorem ipsum.

////
Adding a "row clicked" action to a table prepends each row with a checkbox.
The user can then check one or more boxes to update a dashboard parameter.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that regardless of whether one or more values are selected, the type of the dashboard parameter is a list of values.
The queries using the parameter must ensure that the list type is handled correctly.
