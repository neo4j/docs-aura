:description: The Neo4j dashboard table visualization.


Neo4j dashboard tables can render all data returned by a Cypher query as a result table.
This includes simple data like numbers or text, but also Neo4j-native data like nodes, relationships, and paths.

////
Tables support the following additional features: 

- Automatic pagination of results. 
- Sorting/filtering by clicking on the table headers. 
- Prefixing a column header with `__` (double underscore) will make the column hidden.
- Downloading your data as a CSV file.
////

When you hover over a table cell, a copy icon appears towards the end of the cell.
Click it to copy the content of the table cell to the clipboard.
