= Sharing dashboards
:description: Share your dashboards with people in your project.

You can share your dashboards with people in your project.
You can either invite individual users from your project or share your dashboard with everyone in the project.

a shared dashboard grants READ permission to the users you shared it with.

Either use the three dots icon of a dashboard in the **Dashboards** page and select **Share** or select **Share** at the top right when looking at a particular dashboard.

The **Share** dialog lets you invite more users by selecting email addresses from the **Invite users** dropdown and adding them to the list of **People with access**.

[NOTE]
====
The users you can invite are the same users you can find in the **Users** page under **Project**.
====

You can also toggle and grant **General access** to anyone in the project.
If toggled, it takes precedence over the possibly more restrictive list of people with access.
The list is preserved and applies again as soon as you untoggle **General access**.

When a dashboard is shared, a team icon appears at the top right of the dashboard in the **Dashboards** page.
Hover the icon to learn whether the dashboard is shared with the project or the number of people it is shared with.
