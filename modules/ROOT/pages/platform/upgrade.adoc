= Updates and upgrades

AuraDB does not have any scheduled maintenance windows.
It is designed to be always on and available, with all corrections, fixes, and upgrades automatically applied in the background.

Releases for the Neo4j database are also deployed when they become available.
Operations are non-disruptive, and you shouldnâ€™t experience any downtime as a result.
