= Security

== Encryption

All data stored in Neo4j Aura is encrypted using intra-cluster encryption between the various nodes comprising your database, as well as encrypted at rest using the underlying cloud provider's encryption mechanism.

== VPC isolation

label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]
label:AuraDS-Enterprise[]

AuraDB Enterprise and AuraDS Enterprise run within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) isolation for your deployment.

The VPC enables you to operate within an isolated section of the service, where your processing, networking, and storage are further protected.

Please note that the Aura console runs in a separate VPC.

== Single Sign-On

label:Enterprise-only[]

AuraDB Enterprise supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for accessing the Bloom and Browser clients from a database.

The following OpenID Connect (OIDC) certified Identity Providers (IdPs) are currently supported:

* Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD)
* Okta
* Keycloak
* Google Authentication

[NOTE]
====
Aura supports both Authorization Code Flow with PKCE and Implicit Flow authorization flows.
We strongly advise using PKCE to ensure security. 
====

To add SSO for Browser and Bloom to your AuraDB Enterprise databases, please https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[raise a support ticket] including the following information:

. The *Connection URI* of the database(s) you want to use SSO.
. Whether or not you want Browser, Bloom, or both enabled.
. The name of your IdP.
. The authorization flow (PKCE or Implicit).

[NOTE]
====
If you have to specify an application type when configuring your client, Neo4j is a Single-page application.
For more information on configuring your client, see https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tutorial/tutorial-sso-configuration/[Neo4j Single Sign-On (SSO) Configuration].
====

== Supported TLS cipher suites

For additional security, client communications are carried via TLS v1.2 and TLS v1.3.

AuraDB has a restricted list of cipher suites accepted during the TLS handshake, and does not accept all of the available cipher suites.
The following list conforms to safety recommendations from IANA, the OpenSSL, and GnuTLS library.

TLS v1.3:

* `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (RFC8446)`
* `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (RFC8446)`
* `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (RFC8446)`

TLS v1.2:

* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (RFC5288)`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (RFC5289)`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (RFC5289)`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (RFC7905)`
* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (RFC5288)`
