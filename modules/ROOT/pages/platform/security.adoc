== Encryption

All data stored in Neo4j Aura is encrypted using intra-cluster encryption between the various nodes comprising your instance and encrypted at rest using the underlying cloud provider's encryption mechanism.

By default, each cloud provider encrypts all backup buckets (including the objects stored inside) using either https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/default-keys[Google-managed encryption], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html[AWS SSE-S3 encryption], or https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption[Azure Storage encryption].

== VPC isolation

label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]
label:AuraDS-Enterprise[]

AuraDB Enterprise and AuraDS Enterprise run within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) isolation for your deployment.

The VPC enables you to operate within an isolated section of the service, where your processing, networking, and storage are further protected.

Please note that the Aura Console runs in a separate VPC.

=== AWS Private endpoints

label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]

AuraDB Enterprise supports private endpoints on AWS using https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink[AWS PrivateLink].

Once activated, you can create an endpoint in your VPC that connects to Aura.

image::privatelink.png[title="VPC connectivity with AWS PrivateLink"]

All applications running Neo4j workloads inside the VPC are routed directly to your isolated environment in Aura without traversing the public internet.
You can then disable public traffic, ensuring all traffic to the instance remains private to your VPC.

[NOTE]
====
* PrivateLink applies to all instances in the region. 
* When activated, a *Private Connection* label, shield icon, and dedicated *Private URI* will appear on any instance tile using PrivateLink in the Aura Console.
* If you disable public traffic, you must use a dedicated VPN to connect to your instance via Browser or Bloom.
* Connections using private endpoints are one-way. Aura VPCs can't initiate connections back to your VPCs.
* In AWS region us-east-1, we do not support the Availability Zone with ID use1-az3 for private endpoints.
====

==== Browser and Bloom access over private endpoints

To connect to your instance via Browser or Bloom, you must use a dedicated VPN. This is because when you disable public access to your instance, this applies to all connections, including those from your computer when using Browser or Bloom.

Without private endpoints, you access Browser and Bloom over the internet:

image::privatelink_01_before_enabling.png[title="Architecture overview before enabling private endpoints"]

When you have enabled private endpoints **and** disabled public internet access, you can no longer connect Browser or Bloom to your instances over the internet:

image::privatelink_02_enabled_private_traffic_only.png[title="Architecture overview with private endpoints enabled and public traffic disabled"]

To continue accessing Browser and Bloom, you can configure a VPN (Virtual Private Network) in your VPC and connect to Browser and Bloom over the VPN.

[NOTE]
====
To access Bloom and Browser over a VPN, you must ensure that:

* The VPN server uses the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS[VPC's DNS servers].
* You use the *Private URI* shown on the instance tile and in the instance details. It will be different from the *Connection URI* you used before.

== Single Sign-On

label:AuraDB-Enterprise[]
label:AuraDS-Enterprise[]

Aura Enterprise supports Single Sign-On (SSO) at both the Console level and for accessing Workspace, Bloom and Browser clients directly at the instance level.

[NOTE]
====
Accessing Aura with SSO requires:
 
* Authorization Code Flow with PKCE.
* A publicly accessible Identity Provider (IdP) server.
====

=== Console SSO

Console SSO allows users to log in to the Aura Console using their company IdP credentials and grants link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/current/administration/access-control/built-in-roles#access-control-built-in-roles-public[Public Access privileges] to all instances in the tenant.

The following OpenID Connect (OIDC) certified Identity Providers (IdPs) are currently supported for Console-level Authentication:

* Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD)
* Okta

To enable Console SSO on your Aura Enterprise tenant(s), please https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[raise a support ticket] including the following information:

. The _Tenant ID_ of the tenant(s) you want to use SSO. See xref:platform/user-management.adoc#_tenants[Tenants] for more information on how to find your __Tenant ID__.
. The name of your IdP.

=== Instance SSO

Instance SSO allows you to directly map groups of users (as defined in your IdP) to DBMS RBAC roles when launching Workspace, Bloom and Browser clients from an Aura instance.

The following OIDC certified IdPs are currently supported for instance-level Authentication:

* Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD)
* Okta
* Keycloak
* Google Authentication

To add SSO for Workspace, Bloom, and Browser to your Aura Enterprise instances, please https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[raise a support ticket] including the following information:

. The *Connection URI* of the instance(s) you want to use SSO.
. Whether or not you want Workspace, Bloom, Browser, or a combination of them enabled.
. The name of your IdP.

[NOTE]
====
If you have to specify an application type when configuring your client, Neo4j is a Single-page application.
For more information on configuring your client, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tutorial/tutorial-sso-configuration/[Neo4j Single Sign-On (SSO) Configuration].
====
