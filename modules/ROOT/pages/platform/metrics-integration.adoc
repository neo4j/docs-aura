An application performance monitoring system can be configured to fetch metrics of Neo4j Aura Enterprise instances.
This gives users access to their Neo4j Aura instance metric data for monitoring purposes.
Analyzing the metrics data allows users to:

* Optimize their Neo4j load
* Adjust Aura instance sizing
* Set up notifications

[aura-cmi-process-overview]
== Process overview

image::process.png[]

[aura-cmi-steps]
== Detailed steps

. Log in to Aura as tenant admin.
. Make sure there is a dedicated Aura user to use for fetching metrics.
You can either:
 ** Create a new user:
  ... In https://console.neo4j.io/#user-management["User Management"^] of Neo4j Aura, invite a new user, selecting "Metrics Integration Reader" as a role.
image:invite_user.png[]
  ... Follow the invitation link and log in to Neo4j Aura.
  ... Confirm the tenant membership.
 ** Or you can find an existing user in https://console.neo4j.io/#user-management["User Management"^] and change its role to "Metrics Integration Reader" +
+
[NOTE]
====
Capabilities of users with the role "Metrics Integration Reader" are limited to fetching the metrics and getting a read-only view of the tenant.
====
. Ensure you are logged in to Aura as the user selected in the previous step.
In https://console.neo4j.io/#account["Account Details"^], create new Aura API credentials.
Save client secret. +
image:api_credentials.png[]
. Configure the APM system to fetch metrics from the URL(s) or configuration templates shown in https://console.neo4j.io/#metrics-integration["Metrics Integration"^] of Neo4j Aura. Use `oauth2` type of authentication specifying the Client ID and Client Secret created in the previous step. See examples for <<_example_using_prometheus,Prometheus and Grafana>> and <<_example_using_datadog,Datadog>> below.
. Use the APM system to create visualizations, dashboards, and alarms based on Neo4j metrics.

[aura-cmi-security]
== Security

Metrics for a Neo4j Aura instance are only returned if all the following are true:

* `Authorization` header of the metrics request contains a valid token.
* The token was issued for an Aura user with "Metrics Integration Reader" role.
* Tenant is of type `enterprise`.
* The specified instance belongs to the specified tenant.

[aura-cmi-revoke-access-to-metrics]
.Revoke access to metrics

To revoke a user's access to metrics of a specific tenant, remove the user from that tenant in https://console.neo4j.io/#user-management["User Management"^].
After that, the user still exists but its connection to the tenant is removed.

[NOTE]
====
The revocation described takes effect after the authorization caches expire, which takes approximately 5 minutes.
It results in HTTP 401 being returned, along with the message `User doesn't have access to Metrics resources.`
However, if you remove only the Aura API credentials used to retrieve metrics, the revocation will take effect only after the tokens issued with these credentials expire, as no new token can be issued anymore. Currently used token expiration time is 1 hour.
====

[aura-cmi-metric-labels]
.Metric labels

Depending on the metric, the following labels are applied:

* `aggregation`: the aggregation used to calculate the metric value, set on every metric.
Since the Neo4j instance is deployed as a Neo4j cluster, aggregations are performed to combine values from all relevant cluster nodes.
The following aggregations are used: `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG` and `SUM`.
* `instance_id`: the Aura instance ID the metric is reported for, set on every metric.
* `database`: the name of the Neo4j database the metric is reported for.
Set to `neo4j` by default.

.Example

[source, shell]
----
# HELP neo4j_database_count_node The total number of nodes in the database.
# TYPE neo4j_database_count_node gauge
neo4j_database_count_node{aggregation="MAX",database="neo4j",instance_id="78e7c3e0"} 778114.000000 1711462853000

[aura-cmi-looking-up-metric-name]
.Looking up metric name in Neo4j Aura Advanced Metrics

In Neo4j Aura Advanced Metrics, it is possible to find out the metric name that corresponds to the chart, by using the chart menu item "Metrics Integration" as shown.

[aura-cmi-metric-scrape-interval]
== Metric scrape interval

Recommended scrape interval for metrics is in the range of 30 seconds up to 2 minutes, depending on requirements. The metrics endpoint caches metrics for 30 seconds.

[aura-cmi-example-using-prometheus]
== Example using Prometheus

.Install Prometheus

One way is to get a tarball from link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/[^]

.Configure Prometheus

To monitor one or more instances, add a section to the Prometheus configuration file `prometheus.yml`.

Copy the configuration section proposed in link:https://console.neo4j.io/#metrics-integration[Metrics Integration^], as shown.

[NOTE]
====
Replace the placeholders `<AURA_CLIENT_ID>` and `<AURA_CLIENT_SECRET>` with corresponding values created in the previous step.
====

image::metrics_integration.png[]

For details, see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/[Prometheus configuration reference^].

.Start Prometheus

[source, shell]
----
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
----

.Test that metrics are fetched

Open http://localhost:9090 and enter a metric name or expression in the search field (ex. `neo4j_aura_cpu_usage`).

.Use Grafana

Install and configure Grafana, adding the endpoint of the Prometheus instance configured in the previous step as a data source.
You can create visualizations, dashboards, and alarms based on Neo4j metrics.

[aura-cmi-example-using-datadog]
== Example using Datadog

.Get a Datadog account, link:https://www.datadoghq.com/[^]

.Install a Datadog agent as described in Datadog documentation

.Configure an endpoint with token authentication

Edit `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml` as follows:

[NOTE]
====
Replace the placeholders `<ENDPOINT_URL>`, `<AURA_CLIENT_ID>` and `<AURA_CLIENT_SECRET>` with corresponding values from the previous steps.
====

./etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml

.Test that metrics are fetched

* `sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent`
* Watch `/var/log/datadog/*` to see if fetching metrics happens or if there are warnings regarding parsing the config.
* Check in Datadog metric explorer to see if metrics appear (after a couple of minutes).

 ** endpoint `+/tenants/{tenantId}/metrics-integration+` (for tenant metrics)
 ** JSON property `metrics_integration_url` as part of `+/instances/{instanceId}+` response (for instance metrics)
* Reference: link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/platform/api/specification/[Aura API Specification^]

[aura-cmi-cli-for-metrics-integration]

.Heap Used
[frame="topbot", stripes=odd, grid="cols", cols="<1,<4"]
|===
| Metric name
m| neo4j_dbms_vm_heap_used_ratio
| Description
| The percentage of configured heap memory in use.
The heap space is used for query execution, transaction state, management of the graph etc.
The size needed for the heap is very dependent on the nature of the usage of Neo4j.
For example, long-running queries, or very complicated queries, are likely to require a larger heap than simpler queries.
To improve performance, the heap should be large enough to sustain concurrent operations.
This value should not exceed 80% for long periods, short spikes can be normal.
In case of performance issues, you may have to tune your queries and monitor their memory usage, to determine whether the heap needs to be increased.
If the workload of Neo4j and performance of queries indicates that more heap space is required, consider increasing the size of your instance.
This helps avoid unwanted pauses for garbage collection.
