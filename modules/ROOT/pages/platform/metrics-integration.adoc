label:AuraDB-Business-Critical[]

An application performance monitoring system can be configured to fetch metrics of AuraDB instances of types:

* AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud
* AuraDS Enterprise
* AuraDB Business Critical

This gives users access to their Neo4j Aura instance metric data for monitoring purposes.

Analyzing the metrics data allows users to:

* Optimize their Neo4j load
* Adjust Aura instance sizing
* Set up notifications

[aura-cmi-process-overview]
== Process overview

image::process.png[]

[aura-cmi-steps]
== Detailed steps

. Log in to Aura as project admin.
. Make sure there is a dedicated Aura user to use for fetching metrics.
You can either:
 ** Create a new user:
  ... In https://console.neo4j.io/#user-management["User Management"^] of Neo4j Aura, invite a new user, selecting "Metrics Integration Reader" as a role.
image:invite_user.png[]
  ... Follow the invitation link and log in to Neo4j Aura.
  ... Confirm the project membership.
 ** Or you can find an existing user in https://console.neo4j.io/#user-management["User Management"^] and change its role to "Metrics Integration Reader" +
+
[NOTE]
====
Capabilities of users with the role "Metrics Integration Reader" are limited to fetching the metrics and getting a read-only view of the project.
====
. Ensure you are logged in to Aura as the user selected in the previous step.
In https://console.neo4j.io/#account["Account Details"^], create new Aura API credentials.
Save client secret. +
image:api_credentials.png["API credentials"]
. Configure the APM system to fetch metrics from the URL(s) or configuration templates shown in https://console.neo4j.io/#metrics-integration["Metrics Integration"^] of Neo4j Aura.
Use `oauth2` type of authentication specifying the Client ID and Client Secret created in the previous step.
See examples for <<_example_using_prometheus,Prometheus and Grafana>> and <<_example_using_datadog,Datadog>> below.
. Use the APM system to create visualizations, dashboards, and alarms based on Neo4j metrics.

[aura-cmi-security]
== Security

Metrics for a Neo4j Aura instance are only returned if all the following are true:

* `Authorization` header of the metrics request contains a valid token.
* The token was issued for an Aura user with "Metrics Integration Reader" role.
* Project has instances of types `Enterprise (Virtual Dedicated Cloud)` or `Business Critical`.
* The specified instance belongs to the specified tenant.

[CAUTION]
====
The legacy term `Enterprise` is still used within the codebase and API.
However, in the Aura console and documentation, the AuraDB Enterprise tenant type is now known as AuraDB Virtual Dedicated Cloud.
====

[aura-cmi-revoke-access-to-metrics]
.Revoke access to metrics

To revoke a user's access to metrics of a specific tenant, remove the user from that tenant in https://console.neo4j.io/#user-management["User Management"^].
After that, the user still exists but its connection to the tenant is removed.

[NOTE]
====
The revocation described takes effect after the authorization caches expire, which takes approximately 5 minutes.
It results in HTTP 401 being returned, along with the message `User doesn't have access to Metrics resources.`
However, if you remove only the Aura API credentials used to retrieve metrics, the revocation will take effect only after the tokens issued with these credentials expire, as no new token can be issued anymore. Currently used token expiration time is 1 hour.
====

[aura-cmi-metric-labels]
.Metric labels

Depending on the metric, the following labels are applied:

* `aggregation`: the aggregation used to calculate the metric value, set on every metric.
Since the Neo4j instance is deployed as a Neo4j cluster, aggregations are performed to combine values from all relevant cluster nodes.
The following aggregations are used: `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG` and `SUM`.
* `instance_id`: the Aura instance ID the metric is reported for, set on every metric.
* `database`: the name of the Neo4j database the metric is reported for.
Set to `neo4j` by default.

.Example

[source, shell]

[aura-cmi-metrics-granularity]
== Metrics granularity

The metrics returned by the integration endpoint are grouped based on the labels provided: `aggregation`, `instance_id`, and `database`.

An Aura instance typically runs on multiple servers to achieve availability and workload scalability.
These servers are deployed across different Cloud Provider availability zones in the user-selected region.

Metrics Integration supports a more granular view of the Aura instance metrics with additional data points for availability zone & instance mode combinations.
This view can be enabled on demand.

[NOTE]
====
Contact link:https://support.neo4j.com/[Customer Support] to enable more granular metrics of instances for your tenant.
====

[NOTE]
====
There may be a delay in more granular metrics being available when a new Aura instance is created.
This is because of the way 'availability zone' data is collected.
====

.Example metric data points

.Heap Used
[frame="topbot", stripes=odd, grid="cols", cols="<1,<4"]
|===
| Metric name
m| neo4j_dbms_vm_heap_used_ratio
| Description
| The percentage of configured heap memory in use.
The heap space is used for query execution, transaction state, management of the graph etc.
The size needed for the heap is very dependent on the nature of the usage of Neo4j.
For example, long-running queries, or very complicated queries, are likely to require a larger heap than simpler queries.
To improve performance, the heap should be large enough to sustain concurrent operations.
This value should not exceed 80% for long periods, short spikes can be normal.
In case of performance issues, you may have to tune your queries and monitor their memory usage, to determine whether the heap needs to be increased.
If the workload of Neo4j and performance of queries indicates that more heap space is required, consider increasing the size of your instance.
This helps avoid unwanted pauses for garbage collection.
