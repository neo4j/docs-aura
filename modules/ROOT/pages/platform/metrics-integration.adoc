[aura-customer-metrics-integration]
= Customer Metrics Integration (CMI)

An application performance monitoring system can be configured to fetch metrics of Neo4j Aura Enterprise instances.
This gives users access to their Neo4j Aura instance metric data for monitoring purposes.
Analyzing the metrics data allows users to:

* Optimize their Neo4j load
* Adjust Aura instance sizing
* Set up notifications

[aura-cmi-process-overview]
== Process overview

[aura-cmi-steps]
== Detailed steps

. Make sure there is a dedicated Aura user to use for fetching metrics.
You can either:
 ** Create a new user:
  ... In https://console.neo4j.io/#user-management["User Management"^] of Neo4j Aura, invite a new user, selecting "Metrics Integration Reader" as a role.
image:invite_user.png[]
  ... Follow the invitation link and log in to Neo4j Aura.
  ... Confirm the tenant membership.
 ** Or you can find an existing user in https://console.neo4j.io/#user-management["User Management"^] and change its role to "Metrics Integration Reader" +
+
[NOTE]
====
Capabilities of users with the role "Metrics Integration Reader" are limited to fetching the metrics and getting a read-only view of the tenant.
====
. In https://console.neo4j.io/#account["Account Details"^], create new Aura API credentials. Save client secret. +
image:api_credentials.png[]
. Configure the APM system to fetch metrics from the URL(s) or configuration templates shown in https://console.neo4j.io/#metrics-integration["Metrics Integration"^] of Neo4j Aura. Use `oauth2` type of authentication specifying the Client ID and Client Secret created in the previous step. See examples for <<_example_using_prometheus,Prometheus and Grafana>> and <<_example_using_datadog,Datadog>> below.
. Use the APM system to create visualizations, dashboards, and alarms based on Neo4j metrics.

[aura-cmi-security]
== Security

Metrics for a Neo4j Aura instance are only returned if all the following are true:

* `Authorization` header of the metrics request contains a valid token.
* The token was issued for an Aura user with "Metrics Integration Reader" role.
* Tenant is of type `enterprise`.
* The specified instance belongs to the specified tenant.

[aura-cmi-revoke-access-to-metrics]
.Revoke access to metrics

To revoke a user's access to metrics of a specific tenant, remove the user from that tenant in https://console.neo4j.io/#user-management["User Management"^]. 
After that, the user still exists but its connection to the tenant is removed.

[NOTE]
====
The revocation described takes effect after the authorization caches expire, which takes approximately 5 minutes.
It results in HTTP 401 being returned, along with the message `User doesn't have access to Metrics resources.`
However, if you remove only the Aura API credentials used to retrieve metrics, the revocation will take effect only after the tokens issued with these credentials expire, as no new token can be issued anymore. Currently used token expiration time is 1 hour.
====

[aura-cmi-metric-labels]
.Metric labels

Depending on the metric, the following labels are applied:

* `aggregation`: the aggregation used to calculate the metric value, set on every metric. 
Since the Neo4j instance is deployed as a Neo4j cluster, aggregations are performed to combine values from all relevant cluster nodes. 
The following aggregations are used: `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG` and `SUM`.
* `instance_id`: the Aura instance ID the metric is reported for, set on every metric.
* `database`: the name of the Neo4j database the metric is reported for. 
Set to `neo4j` by default.

.Example

[source, shell]
----
# HELP neo4j_database_count_node The total number of nodes in the database.
# TYPE neo4j_database_count_node gauge
neo4j_database_count_node{aggregation="MAX",database="neo4j",instance_id="78e7c3e0"} 778114.000000 1711462853000

| DefaultAggregation

| Out of Memory errors
| The total number of Out of Memory errors for the instance. 
Consider increasing the size of the instance if any OOM errors.
| `neo4j_aura_out_of_memory_errors_total`
| _Counter_
| SUM

| CPU Available
| The total CPU cores assigned to the instance nodes.
| `neo4j_aura_cpu_limit`
| _Gauge_
| MAX

| CPU Usage
| CPU usage (cores). 
CPU is used for planning and serving queries. 
If this metric is constantly spiking or at its limits, consider increasing the size of your instance.
| `neo4j_aura_cpu_usage`
| _Gauge_
| MAX

| Memory Used
| Memory in use by Neo4j.
| `neo4j_aura_memory_usage`
| _Gauge_
| MAX

| Memory Total
| The total memory assigned to the instance.
| `neo4j_aura_memory_limit`
| _Gauge_
| MAX

| Storage Total
| The total disk storage assigned to the instance.
| `neo4j_aura_storage_limit`
| _Gauge_
| MAX

| Heap Used
| The percentage of configured heap memory in use. 
The heap space is used for query execution, transaction state, management of the graph etc. +
The size needed for the heap is very dependent on the nature of the usage of Neo4j. 
For example, long-running queries, or very complicated queries, are likely to require a larger heap than simpler queries. 
To improve performance, the heap should be large enough to sustain concurrent operations. +
This value should not exceed 80% for long periods, short spikes can be normal. 
In case of performance issues, you may have to tune your queries and monitor their memory usage, to determine whether the heap needs to be increased. 
If the workload of Neo4j and performance of queries indicates that more heap space is required, consider increasing the size of your instance. 
This helps avoid unwanted pauses for garbage collection.
| `neo4j_dbms_vm_heap_used_ratio`
| _Gauge_
| MAX

| Page Cache Hit Ratio
| The percentage of times data required during query execution was found in memory vs needing to be read from disk. 
Ideally, the whole graph should fit into memory, and this should consistently be between 98% and 100%. 
If this value is consistently or significantly under 100%, check the page cache usage ratio to see if the graph is too large to fit into memory. 
A high amount of insert or update activity on a graph can also cause this value to change.
| `neo4j_dbms_page_cache_hit_ratio_per_minute`
| _Gauge_
| AVG

| Page Cache Usage Ratio
| The percentage of the allocated page cache in use. 
If this is close to or at 100%, then it is likely that the hit ratio will start dropping, and you should consider increasing the size of your instance so that more memory is available for the page cache.
| `neo4j_dbms_page_cache_usage_ratio`
| _Gauge_
| MIN

| Bolt Connections Running

| _Counter_
| MAX

| Bolt Connections Opened
| The total number of Bolt connections opened since startup. 
This includes both successful and failed connections. 
This value may drop if background maintenance is performed by Aura.
| `neo4j_dbms_bolt_connections_opened_total`
| _Counter_
| MAX

| Garbage Collection Young Generation
| Shows the total time since startup spent clearing up heap space for short lived objects. 
Young garbage collections typically complete quickly, and the Aura instance waits while the garbage collector is run. 
High values indicate that the instance is running low on memory for the workload and you should consider increasing the size of your instance.
| `neo4j_dbms_vm_gc_time_g1_young_generation_total`
| _Counter_
| MAX

| Garbage Collection Old Generation
| Shows the total time since startup spent clearing up heap space for long-lived objects. 
Old garbage collections can take time to complete, and the Aura instance waits while the garbage collector is run. 
High values indicate that there are long-running processes or queries that could be optimized, or that your instance is running low on CPU or memory for the workload and you should consider reviewing these metrics and possibly increasing the size of your instance.
| `neo4j_dbms_vm_gc_time_g1_old_generation_total`
| _Counter_

| Store Size Database
| Amount of disk space used to store user database data, in bytes. 
Ideally, the database should all fit into memory (page cache) for the best performance. 
Keep an eye on this metric to make sure you have enough storage for today and for future growth. 
Check this metric with page cache usage to see if the data is too large for the memory and consider increasing the size of your instance in this case.
| `neo4j_database_store_size_database`
| _Gauge_
| MAX

| Page Cache Evictions
| The number of times data in memory is being replaced. 
A spike can mean your workload is exceeding the instance's available memory, and you may notice a degradation in performance or query execution errors.
