:description: This page describes how to authenticate requests to the Aura API.

The Aura API uses OAuth 2.0 for API authentication.

== Creating credentials

[NOTE]
====
Enterprise users have unrestricted access to creating API credentials.
However, users with Free and Professional instances must have entered billing information or be a member of a marketplace tenant before they can create API credentials.
====

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/#account[Neo4j Aura Console Account Details page] in your browser.
. Select the *Create* button in the *Aura API Credentials* section.
. Enter a *Client name*, and select *Create*.
. Securely save the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* you are given in the resulting modal; you will need these for the next step.

[CAUTION]
====
You cannot retrieve your secret after you close the modal, so save it securely.
====

== Authenticating API requests

To authenticate API requests to the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/aura/platform/api/specification/[Aura API], you must provide a Bearer Token in the `Authorization` header of each request as shown below:

`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

[TIP]
====
You can use the *Authorize* button on the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/aura/platform/api/specification/[Aura API] page to authenticate and test endpoints directly using your client ID and client secret. The UI sets the `Authorization` header for you.
====

=== Token endpoint

You can use the following `/oauth/token` endpoint to obtain a Bearer Token for authenticating API requests.

Authentication to the token endpoint uses HTTP Basic Authentication, where the client ID and client secret are provided as the username and password, respectively.

==== Request parameters

* Method: `POST`
* Token URL: `\https://api.neo4j.io/oauth/token`

==== Request header

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Parameter |Value

|Authorization footnote:[This header is set for you when providing your client ID as the username and client secret as the password.]
|`Basic <credentials>` footnote:[Where `<credentials>` is the base64-encoded string of your client ID and client secret, joined by a colon (`:`).]

|Content-Type
|`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
|===

==== Request body

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Parameter |Value

|grant_type
|`client_credentials`
|===

[CAUTION]
====
Both the request and response contain sensitive information and must be kept secure.

You are responsible for keeping the client credentials and access tokens confidential, whether in transit (by specifying HTTPS), if stored at rest, in log files, etc.
====

==== Request examples 

[.tabbed-example]
====
[.include-with-cURL]
=====

[source, shell]
----
curl --request POST 'https://api.neo4j.io/oauth/token' \
     --user '<client_id>:<client_secret>' \ <1>
     --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'
----

<1> The `--user` option sets the `Authorization` header for you, handling the base64 encoding of the client ID and client secret.

=====
[.include-with-Python]
=====

[source, python]
----
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Make the request to the Aura API Auth endpoint
response = requests.request(
    "POST",
    "https://api.neo4j.io/oauth/token",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
    data={"grant_type": "client_credentials"},
    auth=HTTPBasicAuth(client_id, client_secret) <1>
)

print(response.json())
----

<1> `client_id` and `client_secret` must be set to the values obtained from the Aura Console.
=====
====


==== Response body example

[source, json, role=nocopy]
----
{
  "access_token": "<token>", <1>
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
----

<1> The `access_token` returned here is what you will provide as the Bearer Token in the `Authorization` header of Aura API requests.

==== HTTP response codes

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Code |Message |Description

|200
|Success
|Access token requested successfully.

|400
|Bad Request
|Request is invalid.

|401
|Unauthorized
|The provided credentials are invalid, expired, or revoked.

|403
|Forbidden
|The request body is invalid.

|404
|Not Found
|The request body is missing.
|===

=== Token expiration

If you attempt to send a request to the Aura API, authenticated using an expired access token, you will receive a 403 Forbidden response.
You will need to obtain a new token to continue using the API.
