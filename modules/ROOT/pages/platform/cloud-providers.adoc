=== 1. Purchase the service

To get started, visit the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/endpoints/prod.n4gcp.neo4j.io[Neo4j Aura for GCP Marketplace page] and click *Purchase*.
Note that you won't be billed until you create a database, so purchasing Neo4j AuraDB on GCP just gets you started.

[discrete]
=== 2. Choose a project

If you purchase the service at the top level of your GCP account, you'll need to choose a target project.
You will only need to _purchase_ Neo4j AuraDB for GCP once, as you can then enable it on a project-by-project basis. However, you still need to choose a target project when you first purchase the service.

[discrete]
=== 3. Enable the service

Once you have purchased the service and switched to a target project, you will get the option to _Enable_ the service for that project.
Click *Enable* to activate Neo4j Aura for GCP on your project.

Once you have enabled the service, you will be directed to the *Neo4j Aura for GCP API* page.
This page displays your service details and billing information.
When this is first set up, you should have no billing history.

[discrete]
=== 4. Completing the set up

To start a database, you can now get to the Neo4j Aura website by clicking *MANAGE VIA NEO4J, INC.*.

[NOTE]
====
When you click "MANAGE VIA NEO4J, INC.", you will be alerted that "You're leaving Google".
When you click *Confirm*, if the Neo4j Aura website fails to open you may need to address any popup blockers in your browser and try again.
====

For security purposes, Neo4j and GCP do not share your login credentials.
You will need to log in to the Neo4j Aura website with the Google account you have used on GCP.

Once logged-in, you'll be asked to accept the Neo4j Aura Terms of Service, before being directed to the Neo4j AuraDB dashboard.
From here, you are ready to create a Neo4j AuraDB database hosted in the GCP region of your choice.
Usage will be billed directly to your GCP billing account.
