== SSO levels

Aura admins can configure organization and tenant level SSO:

. *Organization level SSO*: This configuration applies to all tenants and new database instances created within your organization.

. *Tenant level SSO*:  SSO configured at the tenant level affects all new database instances created within that tenant. It ensures users logging in with SSO have access to the authorized database instances within the tenant.

== Login methods

Admins can configure a combination of one or more of the following login methods:

* Email/password
* Okta
* Microsoft Entra ID
* Google Sign-in

An organization's admin can add Aura as a login from a tile in an organization's Apps Dashboard.

== Setup requirements

Accessing Aura with SSO requires:
 
* Authorization Code Flow
* A publicly accessible Identity Provider (IdP) server

To configure SSO, go to *Aura Console > Settings > SSO Configuration.*

To create a SSO Configuration either a Discovery URI or a combination of Issuer, Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint and JWKS URI is required.

== Instance configurations available from Support

Support can assist with:

* Role mapping specific to a database instance
* Custom groups claim besides `groups`
* Updating SSO on already running instances
