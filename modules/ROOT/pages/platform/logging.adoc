= Query logs


A query log provides a log of queries executed on an instance within a specified time range. 

You can export query logs from an Aura instance via the *Logs* tab.

To access the *Logs* tab:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the instance you want to export the query logs from.
. Select the *Logs* tab.

== Requesting query logs

To request a query log from the *Logs* tab:

. Click *Request log*.
. Select a *Range* option.
. Click *Request*.

You can select from the following time ranges when requesting a query log:

* Last 15 minutes
* Last hour
* Custom range - Any range up to one hour from the previous 30 days

[TIP]
====
We recommend shorter time ranges for busy, read/write heavy instances to reduce request time.
====

Aura will generate a query log for your selected time range, available to download once the *Status* shows *Completed*.

[NOTE]
====
Requested query logs will appear for up to 7 days, at which point they will expire and be removed.
====

== Downloading query logs

You can download query logs with the *Completed Status* by selecting the download icon on the right-hand side of the Query log entry.

Downloaded query logs take the form of a zipped JSON file that, when extracted, contains the following information for each query:
