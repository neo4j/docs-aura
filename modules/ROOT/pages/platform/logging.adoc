A query log provides a log of queries executed on an instance within a specified time range. 

You can export query logs from an Aura instance via the *Logs* tab.

To access the *Logs* tab:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/?product=aura-db[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the instance you want to export the query logs from.
. Select the *Logs* tab.

== Requesting query logs

You can select from the following time ranges when requesting a query log:

* Last 15 minutes
* Last hour
* Custom range - Any one hour from the previous 30 days

To request a query log from the *Logs* tab:

. Click *Request log*.
. Select a *Range* option.

Aura will generate a query log for your selected time range, available to download once the *Status* shows *Completed*.
