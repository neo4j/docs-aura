label:AuraDB-Enterprise[] label:AuraDS-Enterprise[]

User management is a feature within Aura that allows you to invite users and set their roles within an isolated environment.

== Tenants

Tenants are the primary mechanism for granting users access to an Aura environment.

The tenant you're currently viewing is displayed in the header of the Console. 
You can select the tenant name to open the **Tenant Dropdown** menu, which allows you to view the _Tenant ID_.

It is possible to be a member of multiple tenants, in which case the **Tenant Dropdown** will also display the other tenants you have access to. 
You can switch between these tenants by clicking on the individual tenant from the **Tenant Dropdown**.

== Team members

Each tenant consists of a single team that allows multiple users with individual accounts to access the same environment.

The team and its members can be viewed and managed from the **Team Members** page. 
You can access the **Team Members** page by selecting **Team Members** from the sidebar menu of the Console.

=== Roles

Users within a team can have one of two roles, _Admin_ or _Member_.

[NOTE]
====
Each team must have at least one _Admin_, but it is also possible for teams to have multiple _Admins_.
====

_Admins_ can:

* View the team members and their roles.
* Invite new members to the team.
* Edit an existing team member's role.
* Delete existing team members from the team.

_Members_ can:

* View the team members and their roles.

=== Inviting team members

As an _Admin_, to invite a new team member:

. Select **Invite member** from the **Team Members** page.
. Enter the **Email** address of the person you want to invite.
. Select the team member's **Role**.
. Select **Invite**.

The new team member will appear within the list of team members on the **Team Members** page with the _Pending invite_ **Status** until they accept the invite.

[TIP]
====
Tenant invites only appear within the Console and do not generate an email to the user you are inviting.

Therefore, the user you invite must have an existing xref:platform/create-account.adoc[Neo4j Aura account] before they can <<#_accepting_an_invite, accept the invite>>.
====

=== Editing team members

As an _Admin_, to edit an existing team member's role:

. Select the **Edit member** pencil icon next to the team member's name from the **Team Members** page.
. Select the team member's new **Role**.
. Select **Save changes**.

=== Deleting team members

As an _Admin_, to delete an existing team member from the team:

. Select the **Delete member** trash can icon next to the team member's name from the **Team Members** page.
. Select **Delete**.

[NOTE]
====
It is also possible to delete a team member whose **Status** is _Pending invite_.

Select the **Delete member** trash can icon next to the team member's name, and then select **Revoke**.
====

=== Accepting an invite

When invited to a team, a **Tenant invitation** modal will appear the next time you reload the Console. 
You can select the tenant(s) you have been invited to and choose to accept or decline the invite(s). 

You can also close the **Tenant invitation** modal without accepting or declining the invite(s) and later manually re-open the modal by selecting the **Pending invites** envelope icon in the Console header.

[TIP]
====
User management within the Aura Console does not replace built-in roles or fine-grained RBAC at the database level, nor does it limit the ability to perform Console operations such as instance creation.
