:description: Consumption reporting allows Virtual Dedicated Cloud customers to closely monitor their consumption.

label:AuraDB-Virtual-Dedicated-Cloud[]

Virtual Dedicated Cloud services are offered through prepaid consumption plans. Billing is based on usage, with credits deducted from the available balance each month.

The consumption report, accessible in the Aura consoleâ€™s Billing section, provides real-time insights into resource usage for the current tenant, including both running and paused states. 
It displays RAM usage in GB-hours and the equivalent cost in prepaid credits.

Available to Admins, the report helps track usage patterns over time and make informed resource allocation decisions. 
Note that it includes primary database usage but excludes secondary database usage.

== Monitor consumption in real-time

* Filter the usage data by predefined and custom date intervals.
* Look back for a period of up to 3 months. 
* Filter by `Last 24 hours`, `Last 7 days`, `Last 30 days`, `Last 90 days` or a `Custom range`.

The consumption report shows the billing status (`running` = full price or `ended` = only pay 20% of the hourly rate), the total usage in the selected period in GB-hours, and the credit equivalent.
