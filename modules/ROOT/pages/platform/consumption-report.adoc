:description: Consumption reporting allows Virtual Dedicated Cloud customers to closely monitor their consumption.

label:AuraDB-Virtual-Dedicated-Cloud[]

Virtual Dedicated Cloud services are offered through prepaid consumption plans. 
Billing is based on usage, with credits deducted from the available balance each month.

The consumption report, accessible in the Aura consoleâ€™s Billing section, provides real-time insights into resource usage for the current tenant, including both running and paused states. 
It displays RAM usage in GB-hours and the equivalent cost in prepaid credits.

Available to Admins, the report helps you track usage patterns over time and make informed resource allocation decisions. 
Note that it includes primary database usage but **not** secondary database usage.

== Monitor consumption in real-time

=== Billing category

The consumption report shows the billing status, which can be `running` meaning customers are charged the full price, or `paused` meaning customers are charged 20% of the hourly rate.

=== Billing status

Billing status can be `ongoing` or `ended`. 

=== Usage (GB-hours)

Charges are based on the time databases run and the memory consumed, measured in GB-hours. GB-hours usage is calculated by multiplying the number of hours a database is running (whether actively used or not) by the memory size in gigabytes (GB).

The total usage for the selected period is displayed in GB-hours, along with the equivalent credit.

== Filters

* Filter the usage data by predefined and custom date intervals.
* Look back for a period of up to 3 months. 
* Filter by `Last 24 hours`, `Last 7 days`, `Last 30 days`, `Last 90 days` or a `Custom range`.
