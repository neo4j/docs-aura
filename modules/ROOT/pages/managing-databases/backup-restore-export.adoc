= Backup, export and restore
:description: This page describes how to backup, export and restore your data from a snapshot.

The data in your AuraDB database can be backed up, exported, and restored using snapshots.

A snapshot is a copy of the data in a database at a specific point in time.

The *SNAPSHOTS* tab within an AuraDB database shows a list of available snapshots. footnote:[Snapshots are kept in the system for 7 days for Free and Professional plans and 90 days for Enterprise plans.]

To access the *SNAPSHOTS* tab:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the name of the database you want to access.
. Select the *SNAPSHOTS* tab.

== Snapshot types

There are three different types of snapshot:

* *Scheduled* - Runs when you first create a database, when changes to the underlying system occur (for example, a new patch release), and automatically at a cadence depending on your plan type.
footnote:[Automatic scheduled snapshots run once a day for Professional and Free plans and once an hour for Enterprise plans.] 
* *Load* - Runs when you load a dump file from the *IMPORT DATABASE* tab of a database and when you run the `push-to-cloud` command from the *IMPORT* tab at the top of the Aura Console.
* *On-demand* - Runs when you select *Take snapshot* from the *SNAPSHOTS* tab of a database.

== Snapshot actions

=== Backup and Export

You can use any of the *Scheduled* snapshots as a backup or manually trigger an *On-demand* snapshot by selecting *Take snapshot*.

By selecting the ellipses (...) next to a snapshot, you can:

* *Export* - Download the database as *_.dump_* file, allowing you to store a local copy and work on your data offline.
* *Create database from snapshot* - Create a new AuraDB database using the data from the snapshot.

=== Restore

You can restore data in your database to a previous snapshot by selecting *Restore* next to the snapshot you want to restore.

Restoring a snapshot requires you to confirm the action by typing RESTORE and selecting *Restore*. 

[CAUTION]
====
*Caution:*
Restoring a snapshot overwrites the data in your database, replacing it with the data contained in the snapshot.
