= Monitoring

You can monitor several metrics of an Aura database from the *METRICS* tab.

To access the *METRICS* tab:

. Navigate to the https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura Console] in your browser.
. Select the name of the database you want to access.
. Select the *METRICS* tab.

You can set the time frame you want to show data for by selecting a date/time range next to *Show last*.

Each metric has an explanation to the right of the chart, and you can scrub the chart to see data at a specific point in time.
