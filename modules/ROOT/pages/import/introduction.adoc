:description: This is an introduction to the Import data service.
= Import

The import service contains a tool for importing data into your instance and is ideal to get started quickly with testing and prototyping.
It allows you to import data without using any code from:

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* SQL Server
* .CSV

This service is also available as a standalone tool for importing data into self-managed Neo4j instances. The standalone importer is available at the following links, depending upon whether you need support for unsecured connections:

** link:https://data-importer.neo4j.io/[] -- Secure only
** link:https://data-importer.graphapp.io/[] -- Both secure and unsecure
