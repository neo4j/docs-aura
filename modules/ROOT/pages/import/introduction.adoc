:description: This is an introduction to the Import data service.
= Import

The import service contains a tool for importing data into your instance and is ideal to get started quickly with testing and prototyping.
It allows you to import data without using any code from:

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* SQL Server
* .CSV


This means that you can connect to various data sources as well as import data from any source that can be exported to a flat file and does thus not require DBMS filesystem access.

This service is also available as a standalone tool and is accessible at link:https://data-importer.neo4j.io/[] using a secure connection.
Additionally, Data Importer standalone is also available at link:https://data-importer.graphapp.io/[] with both secure and insecure connections.
