[[Overview]]
:description: This section provides an overview of the Import user interface.
= Visual tour

Once you have connected to a data source, Importer's interface is the same regardless of your data source.
It is divided into three parts, the data source panel where you provide the tables/files, the data model panel where you draw your model, and the details panel where you map your model to your tables.

== Data source panel

The source tables for the import are placed here.
If you are using local CSV files, either you drag and drop them here or browse for them.
Each table can be expanded using the dropdown option, to display the header and the first row of the table.
The `...` menu allows you to delete the table.
See xref:import/file-provision.adoc[] for more information about files and tables.

== Data model panel

The center of the UI is the canvas used to create the data model on.
When you have a model, this panel is where you can see if there are errors in mapping.
See xref:import/modeling.adoc[] for more information about the data model.

== Add node

This button adds a node to the data model, **not** to the database.
See xref:import/modeling.adoc[] about how to create the data model.

== Delete selection

Select one or more elements on the canvas and then use this button to delete them.

== More menu

The `...` menu contains options to open a saved model, with or without data, to save your current model, with or without data, settings for the import, and an option to clear everything.
For more information on the settings, see xref:import/mapping.adoc#exclude-list[Node exclude list].

== Details panel

The details panel contains two tabs, _Definition_ and _Constraints & Indexes_.
The _Defintion_ tab is where you give labels to nodes and relationships, map them to files from the data source panel, and specify their properties.
See xref:import/mapping.adoc[] for more information.
The _Constraints & Indexes_ tab allows you to see details about constraints and indexes and lets you add or modify the latter.
See xref:import/indexes-and-constraints.adoc[] for more information.
