== Create an example graph

An easy way to create an in-memory graph is through the GDS https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/graph-generation/#graph-generation[graph generation^] algorithm. By specifing the number of nodes, the average number of relationships going out of each node and the relationship distribution function, the algorithm creates a graph having the following shape:

`(:{generated-graph-size}_Nodes)-[:REL]->(:{generated-graph-size}_Nodes)`
