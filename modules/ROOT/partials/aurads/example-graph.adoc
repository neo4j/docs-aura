== Example graph

We're going to use the database you have specified above to create an in-memory graph. We'll delete this data later on in the tutorial.

We will use the graph generation function within the GDS Library to generate a random in-memory graph.

Our graph is going to be nodes with the label `{example-graph-size}_Nodes` with a relationship of `POWER_LAW`

`(:{example-graph-size}_Nodes)-[:POWER_LAW]->(:{example-graph-size}_Nodes)`

You can read more about the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/graph-generation/#graph-generation[Graph Generation] procedure.
