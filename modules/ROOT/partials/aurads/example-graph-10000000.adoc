== Example Graph

We will use the graph generation function within the GDS Library to generate a random in-memory graph.

Our graph is going to be nodes with the label `10000000_Nodes` with a relationship of `POWER_LAW`

`(:10000000_Nodes)-[:POWER_LAW]->(:10000000_Nodes)`

You can read more about the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/graph-generation/#graph-generation[Graph Generation] procedure. This may take a minute or so to run.
