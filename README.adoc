== GitHub Process

The proposed process below negates the need for forking and due to the release nature of Aura (non-versioned, running updates) only utilise a single permanent main (master) branch.

=== Setup

. Clone the repo onto your local machine.

=== Making changes

. Pull the latest changes from master.
. Create a feature branch for the changes you will be making.
. Work on the changes locally.

=== Landing changes

. Fetch the latest changes on master and merge into your feature branch locally.
. Resolve any merge conflicts that may have arisen.
. Push your feature branch to the repo.
. PR from your feature branch into the master branch.

=== Cleanup

. Delete your feature branch once it has merged into master.

=== Collaboration

. Push your feature branch to the repo.
. Have your colleague checkout your feature branch.

=== Staging changes

. Push your feature branch to the repo.
. Wait until the feature is ready.
. Merge master into you feature branch and PR as usual.

=== Hotfixes

. Make changes on the master branch directly OR create a branch for the hotfix.
